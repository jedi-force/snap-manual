height="1.0486111111111112in"}Lists can be inserted as elements in
larger lists. We can easily create ad hoc structures as needed:

Notice that this list is presented in a different format from the "She
Loves You" list above. A two-dimensional list is called a *table* and is
by default shown in *table view.* We'll have more to say about this
later.

![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image539.png){width="7.343055555555556in"
height="2.78125in"}We can also build any classic computer science data
structure out of lists of lists, by defining *constructors* (blocks to
make an instance of the structure), *selectors* (blocks to pull out a
piece of the structure), and *mutators* (blocks to change the contents
of the structure) as needed. Here we create binary trees with selectors
that check for input of the correct data type; only one selector is
shown but the ones for left and right children are analogous.
