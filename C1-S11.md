 Predicates and Conditional Evaluation
-------------------------------------

height="0.1875in"}Most reporters report either a number, like , or a
text string, like . A *predicate* is a special kind of reporter that
always reports true or false. Predicates have a hexagonal shape:

height="0.15625in"}The special shape is a reminder that predicates don't
generally make sense in an input slot of blocks that are expecting a
number or text. You wouldn't say , although (as you can see from the
picture) Snap*!* lets you do it if you really want. Instead, you
normally use predicates in special hexagonal input slots like this one:

script if (and only if) the expression in its hexagonal input reports
true.

its input script *repeatedly* until a predicate is satisfied:

height="0.84375in"}If, while working on a project, you want to omit
temporarily some commands in a script, but you don't want to forget
where they belong, you can say

Sometimes you want to take the same action whether some condition is
true or false, but with a different input value. For this purpose you
can use the *reporter* if block:

![](image90.png){width="4.208333333333333in"
height="0.3854166666666667in"}The technical term for a true or false
value is a "Boolean" value; it has a capital B because it's named after
a person, George Boole, who developed the mathematical theory of Boolean
values. Don't get confused; a hexagonal block is a *predicate,* but the
value it reports is a *Boolean.*

Another quibble about vocabulary: Many programming languages reserve the
name "procedure" for Commands (that carry out an action) and use the
name "function" for Reporters and Predicates. In this manual, a
*procedure* is any computational capability, including those that report
values and those that don't. Commands, Reporters, and Predicates are all
procedures. The words "a Procedure type" are shorthand for "Command
type, Reporter type, or Predicate type."

value in a hexagonal slot instead of a predicate-based expression, hover
the mouse over the block and click on the control that appears:
