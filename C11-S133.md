### Controls in the Sounds Tab

![](image1093.png){width="0.35in"
height="0.2in"}There is no Sound Editor in Snap*!*, and also no current
sound the way there's a current costume for each sprite. (The sprite
always has an appearance unless hidden, but it doesn't sing unless
explicitly asked.) So the context menu for sounds has only rename,
delete, and export options, and it has a clickable button labeled Play
or Stop as appropriate. There is a sound *recorder,* which appears if
you click the red record button ( ):

The second, square button stops recording. The third, triangular button
plays back a recorded sound. If you don't like the result, click the
round button again to re-record. When you're satisfied, push the Save
button. If you need a sound editor, consider the free (both senses)
