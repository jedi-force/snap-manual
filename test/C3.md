 Building a Block

The first version of Snap*!* was called BYOB, for "Build Your Own
Blocks." This was the first and is still the most important capability
we added to Scratch. (The name was changed because a few teachers have
no sense of humor. â˜¹ You pick your battles.) Scratch 2.0 and later also
has a partial custom block capability.
