### Controls in the Costumes Tab

If you click on the word "Costumes" under
the sprite controls, you'll see something like this:

The Turtle costume is always present in
every sprite; it is costume number 0. Other costumes can be painted
within Snap*!* or imported from files or other browser tabs if your
browser supports that. Clicking on a costume selects it; that is, the
sprite will look like the selected costume. Clicking on the paint brush
icon\
opens the *Paint Editor,* in which you can create a new costume.
Clicking on the camera icon opens a window in which you see what your
computer's camera is seeing, and you can take a picture (which will be
the full size of the stage unless you shrink it in the Paint Editor).
This works only if you give Snap*!* permission to use the camera, and
maybe only if you opened Snap*!* in secure (HTTPS) mode, and then only
if your browser loves you.

Paul's house.*

Control-clicking/right-clicking on the turtle picture gives this menu:

In this menu, you choose the turtle's
*rotation point,* which is also the point from which the turtle draws
lines. The two pictures below show what the stage looks like after
drawing a square in each mode; tip (otherwise known as "Jens mode") is
on the left in the pictures below, middle ("Brian mode") on the right:

As you see, "tip" means the front tip of
the arrowhead; "middle" is not the middle of the shaded region, but
actually the middle of the four vertices, the concave one. (If the shape
were a simple isosceles triangle instead of a fancier arrowhead, it
would mean the midpoint of the back edge.) The advantage of tip mode is
that the sprite is less likely to obscure the drawing. The advantage of
middle mode is that the rotation point of a sprite is rarely at a tip,
and students are perhaps less likely to be confused about just what will
happen if you ask the turtle to turn 90 degrees from the position shown.
(It's also the traditional rotation point of the Logo turtle, which
originated this style of drawing.)

Costumes other than the turtle have a
different context menu:

The edit option opens the Paint Editor on this costume. The rename
option opens a dialog box in which you can rename the costume. (A
costume's initial name comes from the file from which it was imported,
if any, or is something like costume5.) Duplicate makes a copy of the
costume, in the same sprite. (Presumably you'd do that because you
intend to edit one of the copies.) Delete is obvious. The get blocks
option appears only for a smart costume, and brings its script to the
scripting area. The export option saves the costume as a file on your
computer, in your usual downloads folder.

You can drag costumes up and down in the Costumes tab in order to
renumber them, so that next costume will behave as you prefer.

If you drag a *smart picture* of a script
into the Costumes tab, its icon will display the text "\</\>" in the
corner to remind you that it includes code:

Its right-click menu will have an extra get blocks option that switches
to the Scripts tab with the script ready to be dropped there.
