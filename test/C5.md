must be explicitly marked as data by pulling a ring from the Operators
palette and putting the procedure (block or script) inside it:

Here, we are making a list of procedures. But the list block accepts

explicitly that we want the block *itself* as the input, rather than
whatever value would result from evaluating the block.

procedure to the user), and report (for a reporter that reports a
procedure):
