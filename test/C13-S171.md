### Scripts and Blocks Within Scripts

Most of what's described in this section also applies to blocks and
scripts in a Block Editor.

Clicking on a script (which includes a single unattached block) runs it.
If the script starts with a hat block, clicking on the script runs it
even if the event in the hat block doesn't happen. (This is a useful
debugging technique when you have a dozen sprites and they each have
five scripts with green-flag hat blocks, and you want to know what a
single one of those scripts does.) The script will have a green "halo"
around it while it's running. If the script is shared with clones, then
while it has the green halo it will also have a count of how many
instances of the script are running. Clicking a script with such a halo
*stops* the script. (If the script includes a warp block, which might be
inside a custom block used in the script, then Snap*!* may not respond
immediately to clicks.)

If a script is shown with a *red* halo,
that means that an error was caught in that script, such as using a list
where a number was needed, or vice versa. Clicking the script will turn
off the halo.

If any blocks have been dragged into the
scripting area, then in its top right corner you'll see an *undo* and/or
*redo* button that can be used to undo or redo block and script drops.
When you undo a drop into an input slot, whatever used to be in the slot
is restored. The redo button appears once you've used undo.

The third button starts keyboard editing mode (Section D, page 130).

Control-click/right-clicking a primitive block within a script shows a
menu like this one:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1064.png" style="width:60px; height:105px">


command block: reporter block:

The help... option shows the help screen for the block, just as in the
palette. The other options appear only when a block is
right-clicked/control-clicked in the scripting area.

Not every primitive block has a relabel... option. When
present, it allows the block to be replaced by another, similar block,
keeping the input expressions in place. For example, here's what happens
when you choose relabel... for an arithmetic operator:

Note that the inputs to the existing -- block are displayed in the menu
of alternatives also. Click a block in the menu to choose it, or click
outside the menu to keep the original block. Note that the last three
choices are not available in the palette; you must use the relabel
feature to access them.

Not every reporter has a compile option; it exists only for the higher
order functions. When selected, a lightning bolt appears before the
block name:

 and Snap*!* tries to compile the function
inside the ring to JavaScript, so it runs at primitive speed. This works
only for simple functions (but the higher order function still works
even if the compilation doesn't). The function to be compiled must be
quick, because it will be uninterruptable; in particular, if it's an
infinite loop, you may have to quit your browser to recover. Therefore,
**save your project before** you experiment with the compilation
feature. The right-click menu for a compiled higher order function will
have an uncompile option. This is an experimental feature.

The duplicate option for a command block makes a copy of the *entire
script* starting from the selected block. For a reporter, it copies only
that reporter and its inputs. The copy is attached to the mouse, and you
can drag it to another script (or even to another Block Editor window),
even though you are no longer holding down the mouse button. Click the
mouse to drop the script copy.

The block picture underneath the word duplicate for a command block is
another duplication option, but it duplicates only the selected block,
not everything under it in the script. Note that if the selected block
is a C-shaped control block, the script inside its C-shaped slot is
included. If the block is at the end of its script, this option does not
appear. (Use duplicate instead.)

The extract option removes the selected block from the script and leaves
you holding it with the mouse. In other words, it's like the block
picture option, but it doesn't leave a copy of the block in the original
script. If the block is at the end of its script, this option does not
appear. (Just grab the block with the mouse.) A shorthand for this
operation is to *shift-click* and drag out the block.

The delete option deletes the selected block from the script.

The add comment option creates a comment, like the same option in the
background of the scripting area, but attaches it to the block you
clicked.

The script pic... option saves a picture of the entire script, not just
from the selected block to the end, into your download folder; or, in
some browsers, opens a new browser tab containing the picture. In the
latter case, you can use the browser's Save feature to put the picture
in a file. This is a super useful feature if you happen to be writing a
Snap*!* manual! (If you have a Retina display, consider turning off
Retina support before making script pictures; if not, they end up huge.)
For reporters not inside a script, there is an additional result pic...
option that calls the reporter and includes a speech balloon with the
result in the picture. Note: The downloaded file is a "smart picture":
It also contains the code of the script, as if you'd exported the
project. If you later drag the file into the costumes tab, it will be
loaded as a costume. But if you drag it into the *scripts* tab, it will
be loaded as a script, which you can drop wherever you want it in the
scripting area.

If the script does *not* start with a hat block, or you clicked on a
reporter, then there's one more option: ringify (and, if there is
already a grey ring around the block or script, unringify). Ringify
surrounds the block (reporter) or the entire script (command) with a
grey ring, meaning that the block(s) inside the ring are themselves
data, as an input to a higher order procedure, rather than something to
