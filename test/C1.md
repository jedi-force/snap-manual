Saving and Loading Projects and Media
=================

After you've created a project, you'll want to save it, so that you can
have access to it the next time you use Snap*!*. There are two ways to
do that. You can save a project on your own computer, or you can save it
at the Snap*!* web site. The advantage of saving on the net is that you
have access to your project even if you are using a different computer,
or a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. The advantage of
saving on your computer is that you have access to the saved project
while on an airplane or otherwise not on the net. Also, cloud projects
are limited in size, but you can have all the costumes and sounds you
like if you save locally. This is why we have multiple ways to save.

from the File menu. You'll see something like this:

(If you are not logged in to your Snap*!* cloud account, Computer will
be the only usable option.) The text box at the bottom right of the Save
dialog allows you to enter project notes that are saved with the
project.
