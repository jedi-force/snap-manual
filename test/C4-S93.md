### Comma-Separated Values

Spreadsheet and database programs generally offer the option to export
their data as CSV (comma-separated values lists. You can import these
files into Snap*!* and turn them into tables (lists of lists), and you
can export tables in CSV format. Snap*!* recognizes a CSV file by the
extension .csv in its filename.

A CSV file has one line per table row, with the fields separated by
commas within a row:

John,Lennon,rhythm guitar

Paul,McCartney,bass guitar

George,Harrison,lead guitar

Ringo,Starr,drums

Here's what the corresponding table looks like:

Here's how to read a spreadsheet into Snap*!*:

1. Make a variable with a watcher on
stage:

2\. Right-click on the watcher and choose the "import" option. (If the
variable's value is already a list, be sure to click on the outside
border of the watcher; there is a different menu if you click on the
list itself.) Select the file with your csv data.

3\. There is no 3; that's it! Snap*!* will notice that the name of the
file you're importing is something.csv and will turn the text into a
list of lists automatically.

Or, even easier, just drag and drop the file from your desktop onto the
Snap*!* window, and Snap*!* will automatically create a variable named
after the file and import the data into it.

If you actually want to import the raw CSV data into a variable, either
change the file extension to .txt before loading it, or choose "raw
data" instead of "import" in the watcher menu.

If you want to export a list, put a variable watcher containing the list
on the stage, right-click its border, and choose "Export." (Don't
right-click an item instead of the border; that gives a different menu.)

### Multi-dimensional lists and JSON

CSV format is easy to read, but works only for one- or two-dimensional
lists. If you have a list of lists of lists, Snap*!* will instead export
your list as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. I modified my
list:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image608.png" style="width:608px; height:43px">
and then exported again, getting this
file:

\[\[\"John\",\"Lennon\",\"rhythm
guitar\"\],\[\[\"James\",\"Paul\"\],\"McCartney\",\"bass
guitar\"\],\[\"George\",\"Harrison\",\"lead
guitar\"\],\[\"Ringo\",\"Starr\",\"drums\"\]\]

You can also import lists, including tables, from a .json file. (And you
can import plain text from a .txt file.) Drag and drop works for these
formats also.
