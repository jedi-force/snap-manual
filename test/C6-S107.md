### Variables in Ring Slots

Note that the run block in the definition of the my for block (page 65)
doesn't have a ring around its input variable action. When you drag a
variable into a ringed input slot, you generally *do* want to use *the
value of* the variable, which will be the block or script you're trying
to run or call, rather than the orange variable reporter itself. So
Snap*!* automatically removes the ring in this case. If you ever do want
to use the variable *block itself,* rather than the value of the
variable, as a Procedure-type input, you can drag the variable into the
input slot, then control-click or right-click it and choose "ringify"
from the menu that appears. (Similarly, if you ever want to call a
function that will report a block to use as the input, such as item 1 of
applied to a list *of blocks,* you can choose "unringify" from the menu.
Almost all the time, though, Snap*!* does what you mean without help.)
