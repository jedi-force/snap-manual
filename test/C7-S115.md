The primitive if else block has two
C-shaped command slots and chooses one or the other depending on a
Boolean test. Because Scratch doesn't emphasize functional programming,
it lacks a corresponding reporter block to choose between two
expressions. Snap*!* has one, but we could write our own:

Our block works for these simple
examples, but if we try to use it in writing a recursive operator, it'll
fail:

The problem is that when any block is called, all of its inputs are
computed (evaluated) before the block itself runs. The block itself
knows only the values of its inputs, not what expressions were used to
compute them. In particular, all of the inputs to our if then else block
are evaluated ﬁrst thing. That means that even in the base case,
factorial will try to call itself recursively, causing an infinite loop.
We need our if then else block to be able to select only one of the two
alternatives to be evaluated.

We have a mechanism to allow that: declare the then and else inputs to
be of type Reporter rather than type Any. Then, when calling the block,
those inputs will be enclosed in a ring so that the expressions
themselves, rather than their values, become the inputs:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image742.png" style="width:251px; height:145px">


In this version, the program works, with no infinite loop. But we've
paid a heavy price: this reporter-if is no longer as intuitively obvious
as the Scratch command-if. You have to know about procedures as data,
about rings, and about a trick to get a constant value in a ringed slot.
(The id block implements the identity function, which reports its
input.[^6] We need it because rings take only reporters as input, not
numbers.) What we'd like is a reporter-if that *behaves* like this one,
delaying the evaluation of its inputs, but *looks* like our ﬁrst
version, which was easy to use except that it didn't work.

Such blocks are indeed possible. A block that seems to take a simple
expression as input, but delays the evaluation of that input by wrapping
an "invisible ring" around it (and, if necessary, an id-like
transformation of constant data into constant functions) is called a
*special form*. To turn our if block into a special form, we edit the
block's prototype, declaring the inputs yes and no to be of type "Any
(unevaluated)" instead of type Reporter. The script for the block is
still that of the second version, including the use of call to evaluate
either yes or no but not both. But the slots appear as white Any-type
rectangles, not Reporter-type rings, and the factorial block will look
like our ﬁrst attempt.

In a special form's prototype, the unevaluated input slot(s) are
indicated by a lambda (λ) next to the input name, just as if they were
declared as Procedure type. They *are* Procedure type, really; they're
just disguised to the user of the block.

Special forms trade off implementor sophistication for user
sophistication. That is, you have to understand all about procedures as
data to make sense of the special form implementation of my if then
else. But any experienced Scratch programmer can *use* my if then else
without thinking at all about how it works internally.
