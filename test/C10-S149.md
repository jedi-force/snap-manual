The Libraries... option presents a menu of useful, optional block
libraries:<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image385.png" style="width:711px; height:311px">


When you click on the one-line description of a library, you are shown
the actual blocks in the library and a longer explanation of its
purpose. You can browse the libraries to find one that will satisfy your
needs. The libraries are described in detail in Section I.H, page 25.

The Costumes... option opens a browser
into the costume library:

You can import a single costume by clicking it and then clicking the
Import button. Alternatively, you can import more than one costume by
double-clicking each one, and then clicking Cancel when done. Notice
that some costumes are tagged with "svg" in this picture; those are
vector-format costumes that are not (yet) editable within Snap*!*.

If you have the stage selected in the sprite corral, rather than a
sprite, the Costumes... option changes to a Backgrounds... option, with
different choices in the browser:

The costume and background libraries
include both bitmap (go jagged if enlarged) and vector (enlarge
smoothly) images. Thanks to Scratch 2.0/3.0 for most of these images!
Some older browsers refuse to import a vector image, but instead convert
it to bitmap.

The Sounds... option opens the third kind of media browser:

The Play buttons can be used to preview
the sounds.

Finally, the Undelete sprites... option appears only if you have deleted
a sprite; it allows you to recover a sprite that was deleted by accident
(perhaps intending to delete only a costume).

### The Cloud Menu

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image998.png" style="width:28px; height:16px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image489.png" style="width:64px; height:16px">
The cloud icon shows a menu of options
relating to your Snap*!* cloud account. If you are not logged in, you
see the outline icon and get this menu:

Choose Login... if you have a Snap*!* account and remember your
password. Choose Signup... if you don't have an account. Choose Reset
Password... if you've forgotten your password or just want to change it.
You will then get an email, at the address you gave when you created
your account, with a new temporary password. Use that password to log
in, then you can choose your own password, as shown below. Choose Resend
Verification Email... if you have just created a Snap*!* account but
can't find the email we sent you with the link to verify that it's
really your email. (If you still can't find it, check your spam folder.
If you are using a school email address, your school may block incoming
email from outside the school.) The Open in Community Site option
appears only if you have a project open; it takes you to the community
site page about that project.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1001.png" style="width:155px; height:63px">
If you are already logged in, you'll see
the solid icon
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1002.png" style="width:28px; height:16px">
 and get this menu:

Logout is obvious, but has the additional benefit of showing you who's
logged in. Change password... will ask for your old password (the
temporary one if you're resetting your password) and the new password
you want, entered twice because it doesn't echo. Open in Community Site
is the same as above.
