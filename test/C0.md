Blocks, Scripts, and Sprites

This chapter describes the Snap*!* features inherited from Scratch;
experienced Scratch users can skip to SectionÂ B.

Snap*!* is a programming language---a notation in which you can tell a
computer what you want it to do. Unlike most programming languages,
though, Snap*!* is a *visual* language; instead of writing a program
using the keyboard, the Snap*!* programmer uses the same drag-and-drop
interface familiar to computer users.

Start Snap*!*[.]{.smallcaps} You should see
the following arrangement of regions in the window:

(The proportions of these areas may be different, depending on the size
and shape of your browser window.)

A Snap*!* program consists of one or more
*scripts,* each of which is made of *blocks.* Here's a typical script:

The five blocks that make up this script
have three different colors, corresponding to three of the eight
*palettes* in which blocks can be found. The palette area at the left
edge of the window shows one palette at a time, chosen with the eight
buttons just above the palette area. In this script, the gold blocks are
from the Control palette; the green block is from the Pen palette; and
the blue blocks are from the Motion palette. A script is assembled by
dragging blocks from a palette into the *scripting area* in the middle
part of the window. Blocks snap together (hence the name Snap*!* for the
language) when you drag a block so that its indentation is near the tab
of the one above it:

The white horizontal line is a signal that if you let go of the green
block it will snap into the tab of the gold one.
