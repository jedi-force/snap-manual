Sprites and Parallelism

Just below the stage is the "new sprite" button . Click the button to
add a new sprite to the stage. The new sprite will appear in a random
position on the stage, with a random color, but always facing to the
right.

Each sprite has its own scripts. To see the scripts for a particular
sprite in the scripting area, click on the picture of that sprite in the
*sprite corral* in the bottom right corner of the window. Try putting
one of the following scripts in each sprite's scripting area:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image26.png" style="width:149px; height:95px">

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image27.png" style="width:148px; height:112px">


When you click the green flag, you should see one sprite rotate while
the other moves back and forth. This experiment illustrates the way
different scripts can run in parallel. The turning and the moving happen
together. Parallelism can be seen with multiple scripts of a single
sprite also. Try this example:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image28.png" style="width:166px; height:84px">

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image29.png" style="width:166px; height:86px">


When you press the space key, the sprite should move forever in a
circle, because the move and turn blocks are run in parallel. (To stop
the program, click the red stop sign at the right end of the tool bar.)
