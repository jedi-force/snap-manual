### Stage Resizing Buttons

Still in the tool bar, but above the left
edge of the stage, are two buttons that change the size of the stage.
The first is the shrink/grow button. Normally it looks like this:
Clicking the button displays the stage at half-normal size horizontally
and vertically (so it takes up Â¼ of its usual area). When the stage is
half size the button looks like this: and clicking it returns the stage
to normal size. The main reason you'd want a half size stage is during
the development process, when you're assembling scripts with wide input
expressions and the normal scripting area isn't wide enough to show the
complete script. You'd typically then switch back to normal size to try
out the project. The next presentation mode button normally looks like
this: Clicking the button makes the stage double size in both dimensions
and eliminates most of the other user interface elements (the palette,
the scripting area, the sprite corral, and most of the tool bar). When
you open a shared project using a link someone has sent you, the project
starts in presentation mode. While in presentation mode, the button
looks like this: Clicking it returns to normal (project development)
mode.

### Project Control Buttons {#project-control-buttons .ListParagraph}

Above the right edge of the stage are three buttons that control the
running of the project.

Technically, the green flag is no more a project control
than anything else that can trigger a hat block: typing on the keyboard
or clicking on a sprite. But it's a convention that clicking the flag
should start the action of the project from the beginning. It's only a
convention; some projects have no flag-controlled scripts at all, but
respond to keyboard controls instead. Clicking the green flag also
deletes temporary clones.

Whenever any script is running (not necessarily in the
current sprite), the green flag is lit: .

Shift-clicking the button enters Turbo
mode, and the button then looks like a lightning bolt: . Shift-clicking
again turns Turbo mode off.

Scripts can simulate clicking the green
flag by broadcasting the special message

.

The pause button suspends running all
scripts. If clicked while scripts are running, the button changes shape
to become a play button: Clicking it while in this form resumes the
suspended scripts. There is also a pause all block in the Control
palette that can be inserted in a script to suspend all scripts; this
provides the essence of a breakpoint debugging capability. The use of
the pause button is slightly different in visible stepping mode,
described in Chapter I.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1042.png" style="width:53px; height:17px">
The stop button stops all scripts, like
the stop all block. It does *not* prevent a script from starting again
in response to a click or keystroke; the user interface is always
active. There is one exception: generic when blocks will not fire after
a stop until some non-generic event starts a script. The stop button
also deletes all temporary clones.
