###  Custom Blocks with Inputs

But suppose you want to be able to draw squares of different sizes.
Control-click or right-click on the block, choose "edit," and the Block
Editor will open. Notice the plus signs before and after the word square
in the prototype block. If you hover the mouse over one, it lights up:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image509.png" style="width:248px; height:154px">Click on the plus on the right. You will
then see the "input name" dialog:

Type in the name "size" and click OK. There are other options in this
dialog; you can choose "title text" if you want to add words to the
block name, so it can have text after an input slot, like the "move ( )
steps" block. Or you can select a more extensive dialog with a lot of
options about your input name. But we'll leave that for later. When you
click OK, the new input appears in the block prototype:

into the script, then click okay:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image512.png" style="width:67px; height:24px">Your block now appears in the Motion palette with an
input box: You can draw any size square by entering the length of its
side in the box and running the block as usual, by clicking it or by
putting it in a script.
