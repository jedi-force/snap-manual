### Title Text and Symbols

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image687.png" style="width:117px; height:23px">
Some primitive blocks have symbols as
part of the block name: . Custom blocks can use symbols too. In the
Block Editor, click the plus sign in the prototype at the point where
you want to insert the symbol. Then click the title text picture below
the text box that's expecting an input slot name. The dialog will then
change to look like this:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image688.png" style="width:119px; height:26px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image689.png" style="width:195px; height:121px">
The important part to notice is the
arrowhead that has appeared at the right end of the text box. Click it
to see the menu shown here at the left.

Choose one of the symbols. The result will have the symbol you want: The
available symbols are, pretty much, the ones that are used in Snap*!*
icons.

But I'd like the arrow symbol bigger, and
yellow, so I edit its name:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image691.png" style="width:115px; height:26px">
This makes the symbol 1.5 times as big as
the letters in the block text, using a color with red-green-blue values
of 255-255-150 (each between 0 and 255). Here's the result:

The size and color controls can also be used with text:
\$foo-8-255-120-0 will make a huge orange "foo."

Note the last entry in the symbol menu: "new line." This can be used in
a block with many inputs to control where the text continues on another
line, instead of letting Snap*!* choose the line break itself.
