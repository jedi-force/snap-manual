First Class Costumes and Sounds

Costumes and sounds don't have methods, as sprites do; you can't ask
them to do things. But they *are* first class: you can make a list of
them, put them in variables, use them as input to a procedure, and so
on. My \[costumes\] and my \[sounds\] report lists of them.

### Media Computation with Costumes

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image783.png" style="width:157px; height:18px">
The components of a costume are its name, width,
height, and pixels. The block gives access to these components using its
left menu. From its right menu you can choose the current costume, the
Turtle costume, or any costume in the sprite's wardrobe. Since costumes
are first class, you can also drop an expression whose value is a
costume, or a list of costumes, on that second input slot. (Due to a
misfeature, even though you can select Turtle in the right menu, the
block reports 0 for its width and height, and an empty string for the
other components.) The costume's width and height are in its standard
orientation, regardless of the sprite's current direction. (This is
different from the *sprite's* width and height, reported by the my
block.)

But the really interesting part of a costume is its bitmap, a list of
*pixels*. (A pixel, short for "picture element," represents one dot on
your display.) Each pixel is itself a list of four items, the red,
green, and blue components of its color (in the range 0-255) and what is
standardly called its "transparency" but should be called its opacity,
also in the range 0-255, in which 0 means that the pixel is invisible
and 255 means that it's fully opaque: you can't see anything from a
rearward layer at that point on the stage. (Costume pixels typically
have an opacity of 0 only for points inside the bounding box of the
costume but not actually part of the costume; points in the interior of
a costume typically have an opacity of 255. Intermediate values appear
mainly at the edge of a costume, or at sharp boundaries between colors
inside the costume, where they are used to reduce "jaggies": the
stairstep-like shape of a diagonal line displayed on an array of
discrete rectangular screen coordinates. Note that the opacity of a
*sprite* pixel is determined by combining the costume's opacity with the
sprite's ghost effect. (The latter really is a measure of transparency:
0 means opaque and 100 means invisible.)

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image784.png" style="width:586px; height:133px">
The bitmap is a one-dimensional list of
pixels, not an array of *height* rows of *width* pixels each. That's why
the pixel list has to be combined with the dimensions to produce a
costume. This choice partly reflects the way bitmaps are stored in the
computer's hardware and operating system, but also makes it easy to
produce transformations of a costume with map:

In this simplest possible transformation, the red value of all the
pixels have been changed to a constant 150. Colors that were red in the
original (such as the logo printed on the t-shirt) become closer to
black (the other color components being near zero); the blue jeans
become purple (blue plus red); perhaps counterintuitively, the white
t-shirt, which has the maximum value for all three color components,
loses some of its red and becomes cyan, the color opposite red on the
color wheel. In reading the code, note that the function that is the
first input to map is applied to a single pixel, whose first item is its
red component. Also note that this process works only on bitmap
costumes; if you call pixels of on a vector costume (one with "svg" in
the corner of its picture), it will be converted to pixels first.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image790.png" style="width:217px; height:27px">
One important point to see here is that a
bitmap (list of pixels) is not, by itself, a costume. The new costume
block creates a costume by combining a bitmap, a width, and a height.
But, as in the example above, switch to costume will accept a bitmap as
input and will automatically use the width and height of the current
costume. Note that there's no name input; costumes computed in this way
are all named costume. Note also that the use of switch to costume does
*not* add the computed costume to the sprite's wardrobe; to do that, say

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image791.png" style="width:721px; height:116px">
Here's a more interesting example of color
manipulation:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image797.png" style="width:438px; height:39px">
Each color value is constrained to be 0,
80, 160, or 240. This gives the picture a more cartoonish look.
Alternatively, you can do the computation taking advantage of
hyperblocks:

Here's one way to exchange red and green values:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image798.png" style="width:720px; height:63px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image804.png" style="width:92px; height:17px">
It's the list that determines the
rearrangement of colors: green➔red, red➔green, and the other two
unchanged. That list is inside another list because otherwise it would
be selecting *rows* of the pixel array, and we want to select columns.
We use pixels of costume current rather than costume apple because the
latter is always a red apple, so this little program would get stuck
turning it green, instead of alternating colors.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image805.png" style="width:535px; height:41px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image809.png" style="width:165px; height:22px">
The stretch block takes a costume as its
first input, either by selecting a costume from the menu or by dropping
a costume-valued expression such as onto it. The other two inputs are
percents of the original width and height, as advertised, so you can
make fun house mirror versions of costumes:

The resulting costumes can be used with switch to costume and so on.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image305.png" style="width:512px; height:34px">
Finally, you can use pictures from your
computer's camera in your projects using these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image813.png" style="width:141px; height:23px">
Using the video on block turns on the
camera and displays what it sees on the stage, regardless of the inputs
given. The camera remains on until you click the red stop button, your
program runs the stop all block, or you turn it off explicitly with the
block. The video image on the stage is partly ghosted, to an extent
determined by the set video transparency block, whose input really is
transparency and not opacity. (Small numbers make the video more
visible.) By default, the video image is mirrored, like the selfie
camera on your cell phone: When you raise your left hand, your image
raises its right hand. You can control this
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image814.png" style="width:135px; height:23px">
mirroring with the block.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image815.png" style="width:116px; height:155px">
The video snap on block then takes a still picture
from the camera, and trims it to fit on the selected sprite. (Video snap
on stage means to use the entire stage-sized rectangle.) For example,
here's a camera snapshot trimmed to fit Alonzo:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image816.png" style="width:256px; height:125px">
The "Video Capture" project in the
Examples collection repeatedly takes such trimmed snapshots and has the
Alonzo sprite use the current snapshot as its costume, so it looks like
this:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image817.png" style="width:256px; height:192px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image818.png" style="width:320px; height:240px">
(The picture above was actually taken with transparency
set to 50, to make the background more visible for printing.) Because
the sprite is always still in the place where the snapshot was taken,
its costume exactly fits in with the rest of the full-stage video. If
you were to add a move 100 steps block after the switch to costume,
you'd see something like this:

This time, the sprite's costume was captured at one position, and then
the sprite is shown at a different position. (You probably wouldn't want
to do this, but perhaps it's helpful for explanatory purposes.)

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image819.png" style="width:708px; height:158px">
What you *would* want to do is push the
sprite around the stage:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image825.png" style="width:297px; height:185px">
(Really these should be Jens's picture;
it's his project. But he's vacationing. ☺) Video motion compares two
snapshots a moment apart, looking only at the part within the given trim
(here myself, meaning the current sprite, not the person looking into
the camera), to detect a difference between them. It reports a number,
measuring the number of pixels through which some part of the picture
has moved. Video direction also compares two snapshots to detect motion,
but what it reports is the direction (in the point in direction sense)
of the motion. So the script above moves the sprite in the direction in
which it's being pushed, but only if a significant amount of motion is
found; otherwise the sprite would jiggle around too much. And yes, you
can run the second script without the first to push a balloon around the
stage.
