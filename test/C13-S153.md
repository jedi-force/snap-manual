Still in the tool bar, but above the left
edge of the stage, are two buttons that change the size of the stage.
The first is the shrink/grow button. Normally it looks like this:
Clicking the button displays the stage at half-normal size horizontally
and vertically (so it takes up Â¼ of its usual area). When the stage is
half size the button looks like this: and clicking it returns the stage
to normal size. The main reason you'd want a half size stage is during
the development process, when you're assembling scripts with wide input
expressions and the normal scripting area isn't wide enough to show the
complete script. You'd typically then switch back to normal size to try
out the project. The next presentation mode button normally looks like
this: Clicking the button makes the stage double size in both dimensions
and eliminates most of the other user interface elements (the palette,
the scripting area, the sprite corral, and most of the tool bar). When
you open a shared project using a link someone has sent you, the project
starts in presentation mode. While in presentation mode, the button
looks like this: Clicking it returns to normal (project development)
mode.
