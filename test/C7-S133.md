Local State with Script Variables

This script implements an object *class*,
a type of object, namely the counter class. In this Ô¨Årst simplified
version there is only one method, so no explicit message passing is
necessary. When the make a counter block is called, it reports a
procedure, the ringed script inside its body. That procedure implements
a specific counter object, an *instance* of the counter class. When
invoked, a counter instance increases and reports its count variable.
Each counter has its own local count:

This example will repay careful study, because it isn't obvious why each
instance has a separate count. From the point of view of the make a
counter procedure, each invocation causes a new count variable to be
created. Usually such *script variables* are temporary, going out of
existence when the script ends. But this one is special, because make a
counter returns *another script* that makes reference to the count
variable, so it remains active. (The script variables block makes
variables local to a script. It can be used in a sprite's script area or
in the Block Editor. Script variables can be "exported" by being used in
a reported procedure, as here.)

In this approach to OOP, we are representing both classes and instances
as procedures. The make a counter block represents the class, while each
instance is represented by a nameless script created each time make a
counter is called. The script variables created inside the make a
counter block but outside the ring are *instance variables,* belonging
to a particular counter.
