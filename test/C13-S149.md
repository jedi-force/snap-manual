###  The Settings Menu

The settings icon shows a menu of Snap*!*
options, either for the current project or for you permanently,
depending on the option:

The Language... option lets you see the Snap*!* user interface (blocks
and messages) in a language other than English. (Note: Translations have
been provided by Snap*!* users. If your native language is missing, send
us an email!)

The Zoom blocks\... option lets you change the size of blocks, both in
the palettes and in scripts. The standard size is 1.0 units. The main
purpose of this option is to let you take very high-resolution pictures
of scripts for use on posters. It can also be used to improve
readability when projecting onto a screen while lecturing, but bear in
mind that it doesn't make the palette or script areas any wider, so your
computer's command-option-+ feature may be more practical. Note that a
zoom of 2 is gigantic! Don't even try 10.

The Fade blocks... option opens a dialog in which you can change the
appearance of blocks:

Mostly this is a propaganda aid to use on
people who think that text languages are somehow better or more grown up
than block languages, but some people do prefer less saturated block
colors. You can use the pulldown menu for preselected fadings, use the
slider to see the result as you change the fading amount, or type a
number into the text box once you've determined your favorite value.

The Stage size... option lets you set the size of the *full-size* stage
in pixels. If the stage is in half-size or double-size (presentation
mode), the stage size values don't change; they always reflect the
full-size stage.

The Microphone resolution... option sets the buffer size used by the
microphone block in Settings. "Resolution" is an accurate name if you
are getting frequency domain samples; the more samples, the narrower the
range of frequencies in each sample. In the time domain, the buffer size
determines the length of time over which samples are collected.

The remaining options let you turn various features on and off. There
are three groups of checkboxes. The first is for temporary settings not
saved in your project nor in your user preferences.

The JavaScript extensions option enables the use of the JavaScript
function block. Because malicious projects could use JavaScript to
collect private information about you, or to delete or modify your saved
projects, you must enable JavaScript *each time* you load a project that
uses it.

The Extension blocks option adds two
blocks to the palette:

These blocks provide assorted capabilities to official libraries that
were formerly implemented with the JavaScript function block. This
allows these libraries to run without requiring the JavaScript
extensions option. Details are subject to change.

Input sliders provides an alternate way to
put values in numeric input slots; if you click in such a slot, a slider
appears that you can control with the mouse:

The range of the slider will be from 25 less than the input's current
value to 25 more than the current value. If you want to make a bigger
change than that, you can slide the slider all the way to either end,
then click on the input slot again, getting a new slider with a new
center point. But you won't want to use this technique to change the
input value from 10 to 1000, and it doesn't work at all for non-integer
input ranges. This feature was implemented because software keyboard
input on phones and tablets didn't work at all in the beginning, and
still doesn't work perfectly on Android devices, so sliders provide a
workaround. It has since found another use in providing "lively"
response to input changes; if Input sliders is checked, reopening the
settings menu will show an additional option called Execute on slider
change. If this option is also checked, then changing a slider in the
scripting area automatically runs the script in which that input
appears. The project live-tree in the Examples collection shows how this
can be used; it features a fractal tree custom block with several
inputs, and you can see how each input affects the picture by moving a
slider.

Turbo mode makes many projects run much faster, at the cost of not
keeping the stage display up to date. (Snap*!* ordinarily spends most of
its time drawing sprites and updating variable watchers, rather than
actually carrying out the instructions in your scripts.) So turbo mode
isn't a good idea for a project with glide blocks or one in which the
user interacts with animated characters, but it's great for drawing a
complicated fractal, or computing the first million digits of ùúã, so that
you don't need to see anything until the final result. While in turbo
mode, the button that normally shows a green flag instead shows a green
lightning bolt. (But when ‚öë clicked hat blocks still activate when the
button is clicked.)
