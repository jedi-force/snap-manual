Clicking a *custom* block in a script
gives a similar but different menu:

The relabel... option for custom blocks shows a menu of other same-shape
custom blocks with the same inputs. At present you can't relabel a
custom block to a primitive block or vice versa. The two options at the
bottom, for custom blocks only, are the same as in the palette. The
other options are the same as for primitive commands.

If a reporter block is in the scripting
area, possibly with inputs included, but not itself serving as input to
another block, then the menu is a little different again:

What's new here is the result pic... option. It's like script pic... but
it includes in the picture a speech balloon with the result of calling
the block.

Broadcast and broadcast and wait blocks in the scripting area have an
additional option: receivers.... When clicked, it causes a momentary (be
looking for it when you click!) halo around the picture in the sprite
corral of those sprites that have a when I receive hat block for the
same message. Similarly, when I receive blocks have a senders... option
that light up the sprite corral icons of sprites that broadcast the same
message.

**Scripting Area Background Context Menu**

Control-click/right-click on the grey
striped background of the scripting area gives this menu:

The undrop option is a sort of "undo"
feature for the common case of dropping a block somewhere other than
where you meant it to go. It remembers all the dragging and dropping
you've done in this sprite's scripting area (that is, other sprites have
their own separate drop memory), and undoes the most recent, returning
the block to its former position, and restoring the previous value in
the relevant input slot, if any. Once you've undropped something, the
redrop option appears, and allows you to repeat the operation you just
undid. These menu options are equivalent to the and buttons described
earlier.

The clean up option rearranges the position of scripts so that they are
in a single column, with the same left margin, and with uniform spacing
between scripts. This is a good idea if you can't read your own project!

The add comment option puts a comment box,
like the picture to the right, in the scripting area. It's attached to
the mouse, as with duplicating scripts, so you position the mouse where
you want the comment and click to release it. You can then edit the text
in the comment as desired.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1073.png" style="width:133px; height:23px">
You can drag the bottom right corner of
the comment box to resize it. Clicking the arrowhead at the top left
changes the box to a single-line compact form, , so that you can have a
number of collapsed comments in the scripting area and just expand one
of them when you want to read it in full.

If you drag a comment over a block in a script, the comment will be
attached to the block with a yellow line:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1074.png" style="width:143px; height:81px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1075.png" style="width:320px; height:90px">
Comments have their own context menu, with
obvious meanings:

Back to the options in the menu for the background of the scripting area
(picture on the previous page):

The scripts pic... option saves, or opens a new browser tab with, a
picture of *all* scripts in the scripting area, just as they appear, but
without the grey striped background. Note that "all scripts in the
scripting area" means just the top-level scripts of the current sprite,
not other sprites' scripts or custom block definitions. This is also a
"smart picture"; if you drag it into the scripting area, it will *create
a new sprite* with those scripts in its scripting area.

Finally, the make a block... option does the same thing as the "Make a
block" button in the palettes. It's a shortcut so that you don't have to
keep scrolling down the palette if you make a lot of blocks.
