Try this script:

![](image94.png){width="1.8854166666666667in" height="1.4375in"\}
The input to the move block is an orange oval. To get
it there, drag the orange oval that's part of the for block:

The orange oval is a *variable:* a symbol that represents a value. (I
took this screenshot before changing the second number input to the for
block from the default 10 to 200, and before dragging in a turn block.)
For runs its script input repeatedly, just like repeat, but before each
repetition it sets the variable i to a number starting with its first
numeric input, adding 1 for each repetition, until it reaches the second
numeric input. In this case, there will be 200 repetitions, first with
i=1, then with i=2, then 3, and so on until i=200 for the final
repetition. The result is that each move draws a longer and longer line
segment, and that's why the picture you see is a kind of spiral. (If you
try again with a turn of 90 degrees instead of 92, you'll see why this
picture is called a "squiral.")

The variable i is created by the for block, and it can
only be used in the script inside the block's C-slot. (By the way, if
you don't like the name i, you can change it by clicking on the orange
oval without dragging it, which will pop up a dialog window in which you
can enter a different name:

"I" isn't a very descriptive name; you might prefer "length" to indicate
its purpose in the script. "I" is traditional because mathematicians
tend to use letters between i and n to represent integer values, but in
programming languages we don't have to restrict ourselves to
single-letter variable names.)
