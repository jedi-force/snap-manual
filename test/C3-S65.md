If you lose your project, do this first!

If you are still in **Snap*!*** and
realize that you've loaded another project without saving the one you
were working on: ***Don't edit the new project.*** From the File menu
choose the Restore unsaved project option.

Restore unsaved project will also work if you log out of Snap*!* and
later log back in, as long as you don't edit another project meanwhile.
Snap*!* remembers only the most recent project that you've edited (not
just opened, but actually changed in the project editor).

If your project on the cloud is missing, empty, or otherwise broken and
isn't the one you edited most recently, or if Restore unsaved project
fails: ***Don't edit the broken project.*** In the Open... box, enter
your project name, then push the Recover button. *Do this right away,*
because we save only the version before the most recent, and the latest
before today. So don't keep saving bad versions; Recover right away. The
Recover feature works only on a project version that you actually saved,
so Restore unsaved project is your first choice if you switch away from
a project without saving it.

To help you remember to save your projects, when you've edited the
project and haven't yet saved it, Snap*!* displays a pencil icon to the
left of the project name on the toolbar at the top of the window:
