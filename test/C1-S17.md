In the name example above, our project is going to
carry on an interaction with the user, and we want to remember their
name throughout the project. That's a good example of a situation in
which a *global* variable (the kind you make with the "Make a variable"
button) is appropriate. Another common example is a variable called
"score" in a game project. But sometimes you only need a variable
temporarily, during the running of a particular script. In that case you
can use the script variables block to make the variable:

As in the for block, you can click on an orange oval in the script
variables block without dragging to change its name. You can also make
more than one temporary variable by clicking on the right arrow at the
end of the block to add another variable oval:
