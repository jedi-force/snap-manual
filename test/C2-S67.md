Private and Public Projects

By default, a project you save in the cloud is private; only you can see
it. There are two ways to make a project available to others. If you
share a project, you can give your friends a project URL (in your
browser's URL bar after you open the project) they can use to read it.
If you publish a project, it will appear on the Snap*!* web site, and
the whole world can see it. In any case, nobody other than you can ever
overwrite your project; if others ask to save it, they get their own
copy in their own account.
