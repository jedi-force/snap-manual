Renaming variables

There are several reasons why you might want to change the name of a
variable:

1.  It has a default name, such as the "a" in script variables or the
    "i" in for.

2.  It conflicts with another name, such as a global variable, that you
    want to use in the same script.

3.  You just decide a different name would be more self-documenting.

everywhere it appears in that script, or even in all scripts. In the
second case, if you've already used both variables in the script before
realizing that they have the same name, you'll want to look at each
instance separately to decide which ones to rename. Both of these
operations are possible by right-clicking or control-clicking on a
variable oval.

If you right-click on the place where the
variable is *defined* (a script variables block, the orange oval for a
