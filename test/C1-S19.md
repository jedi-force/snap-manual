There are several reasons why you might want to change the name of a
variable:

1.  It has a default name, such as the "a" in script variables or the
    "i" in for.

2.  It conflicts with another name, such as a global variable, that you
    want to use in the same script.

3.  You just decide a different name would be more self-documenting.

In the first and third case, you probably want to change the name
everywhere it appears in that script, or even in all scripts. In the
second case, if you've already used both variables in the script before
realizing that they have the same name, you'll want to look at each
instance separately to decide which ones to rename. Both of these
operations are possible by right-clicking or control-clicking on a
variable oval.

context in which the variable is *used,* then you are able to rename
just that one orange oval:

height="0.7430555555555556in"}If you right-click on the place where the
variable is *defined* (a script variables block, the orange oval for a
global variable in the Variables palette, or an orange oval that's built
into a block such as the "i" in for), then you are given two renaming
options, "rename" and "rename all." If you choose "rename," then the
name is changed only in that one orange oval, as in the previous case:

height="0.8333333333333334in"}But if you choose "rename all," then the
name will be changed throughout the scope of the variable (the script
for a script variable, or everywhere for a global variable):
