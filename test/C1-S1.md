### Hat Blocks and Command Blocks {#hat-blocks-and-command-blocks .ListParagraph}

At the top of the script is a *hat* block, which indicates when the
script should be carried out. Hat block names typically start with the
word "when"; in the square-drawing example on page 5, the script should
be run when the green flag near the right end of the Snap*!* tool bar is
clicked. (The Snap*!* tool bar is part of the Snap*!* window, not the
same as the browser's or operating system's menu bar.) A script isn't
required to have a hat block, but if not, then the script will be run
only if the user clicks on the script itself. A script can't have more
than one hat block, and the hat block can be used only at the top of the
script; its distinctive shape is meant to remind you of that.[^1]

The other blocks in our example script are *command*
blocks. Each command block corresponds to an action that Snap*!* already
knows how to carry out. For example, the block tells the sprite (the
arrowhead shape on the *stage* at the right end of the window) to move
ten steps (a step is a very small unit of distance) in the direction in
which the arrowhead is pointing. We'll see shortly that there can be
more than one sprite, and that each sprite has its own scripts. Also, a
sprite doesn't have to look like an arrowhead, but can have any picture
as a *costume.* The shape of the move block is meant to remind you of a
Lego™ brick; a script is a stack of blocks. (The word "block" denotes
both the graphical shape on the screen and the procedure, the action,
that the block carries out.)

The number 10 in the move block above is
called an *input* to the block. By clicking on the white oval, you can
type any number in place of the 10. The sample script on the previous
page uses 100 as the input value. We'll see later that inputs can have
non-oval shapes that accept values other than numbers. We'll also see
that you can compute input values, instead of typing a particular value
into the oval. A block can have more than one input slot. For example,
the glide block located about halfway down the Motion palette has three
inputs.

Most command blocks have that brick shape, but some, like the repeat
block in the sample script, are *C‑shaped.* Most C-shaped blocks are
found in the Control palette. The slot inside the C shape is a special
kind of input slot that accepts a *script* as the input.

In the sample script

C-shaped blocks can be put in a script in
two ways. If you see a white line and let go, the block will be inserted
into the script like any command block:

But if you see an orange halo and let go,
the block will *wrap* around the haloed blocks:

The halo will always extend from the
cursor position to the bottom of the script:

If you want only some of those blocks, after wrapping you can grab the
first block you don't want wrapped, pull it down, and snap it under the
C-shaped block.

For "E-shaped" blocks with more than one
C-shaped slot, only the first slot will wrap around existing blocks in a
script, and only if that C-shaped slot is empty before wrapping. (You
can fill the other slots by dragging blocks into the desired slot.)
