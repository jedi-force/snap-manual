Etcetera
--------

This manual doesn't explain every block in detail. There are many more
motion blocks, sound blocks, costume and graphics effects blocks, and so
on. You can learn what they all do by experimentation, and also by
reading the "help screens" that you can get by right-clicking or
control-clicking a block and selecting "help..." from the menu that
appears. If you forget what palette (color) a block is, but you remember
at least part of its name, type control-F and enter the name in the text
block that appears in the palette area.

Here are the primitive blocks that don't exist in Scratch:

 reports a new costume consisting of
everything that's drawn on the stage by any sprite. Right-clicking the
block in the scripting area gives the option to change it to if vector
logging is enabled. See page 116.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image137.png" style="width:200px; height:36px">
Print characters in the given point size on the stage,
at the sprite's position and in its direction. The sprite moves to the
end of the text. (That's not always what you want, but you can save the
sprite's position before using it, and sometimes you need to know how
big the text turned out to be, in turtle steps.) If the pen is down, the
text will be underlined.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image138.png" style="width:115px; height:49px">
Takes a sprite as input. Like stamp except
that the costume is stamped onto the selected sprite instead of onto the
stage. (Does nothing if the current sprite doesn't overlap the chosen
sprite.)

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image139.png" style="width:114px; height:33px">
Takes a sprite as input. Erases from that
sprite's costume the area that overlaps with the current sprite's
costume. (Does not affect the costume in the chosen sprite's wardrobe,
only the copy currently visible.)

 See page 6. See page 17.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image143.png" style="width:164px; height:22px">
Reporter version of the if/else primitive command block.
Only one of the two branches is evaluated, depending on the value of the
first input.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image144.png" style="width:176px; height:59px">
Looping block like repeat but with an index variable.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image145.png" style="width:132px; height:28px">
Declare local variables in a script.

 See page 91.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image149.png" style="width:263px; height:20px">
Constant true or false value. See page 12.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image153.png" style="width:204px; height:17px">

Create a primitive using JavaScript. (This block is disabled by default;
the user must check "Javascript extensions" in the setting menu *each
time* a project is loaded.)

The at block lets you examine the screen
pixel directly behind the rotation center of a sprite, the mouse, or an
arbitrary (x,y) coordinate pair dropped onto the second menu slot. The
first five items of the left menu let you examine the color visible at
the position. (The "RGBA" option reports a list.) The "sprites" option
reports a list of all sprites, including this one, any point of which
overlaps this sprite's rotation center (behind or in front). This is a
hyperblock with respect to its second input.

 Checks the data type of a value.

Turn the text into a list, using the second input as
the delimiter between items. The default delimiter, indicated by the
brown dot in the input slot, is a single space character. "Letter" puts
each character of the text in its own list item. "Word" puts each word
in an item. (Words are separated by any number of consecutive space,
tab, carriage return, or newline characters.) "Line" is a newline
character (0xa); "tab" is a tab character (0x9); "cr" is a carriage
return (0xd). "Csv" and "json" split formatted text into lists of lists;
see page 54. "Blocks" takes a script as the first input, reporting a
list structure representing the structure of the script. See Chapter XI.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image170.png" style="width:142px; height:18px">
For lists, reports true only if its two
input values are the very same list, so changing an item in one of them
is visible in the other. (For =, lists that look the same are the same.)
For text strings, uses case-sensitive comparison, unlike =, which is
case-independent.

These *hidden* blocks can be found with
the relabel option of any dyadic arithmetic block. They're hidden partly
because writing them in Snap*!* is a good, pretty easy programming
exercise. Note: the two inputs to atan2 are Δ*x* and Δ*y* in that order,
because we measure angles clockwise from north. Max and min are
*variadic;* by clicking the arrowhead, you can provide additional
inputs.

 Similarly, these hidden predicates can be found by
relabeling the relational predicates.
