Variables palette for blocks that don't fit any category.

There are three block shapes, following a convention that should be
familiar to Scratch users: The jigsaw-puzzle-piece shaped blocks are
Commands, and don't report a value. The oval blocks are Reporters, and
the hexagonal blocks are Predicates, which is the technical term for
reporters that report Boolean (true or false) values.

Suppose you want to make a block named "square" that draws a square. You
would choose Motion, Command, and type "square" into the name field.
When you click OK, you enter the Block Editor. This works just like
making a script in the sprite's scripting area, except that the "hat"
block at the top, instead of saying something like "when I am clicked,"
has a picture of the block you're building. This hat block is called the
*prototype* of your custom block.[^3] You drag blocks under the hat to
program your custom block, then click OK:

Your block appears at the bottom of the Motion palette. Here's the block
and the result of using it:
