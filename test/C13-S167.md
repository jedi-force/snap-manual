### Sprite Appearance and Behavior Controls

At the top of the scripting area are a picture of the sprite and some
controls for it:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1058.png" style="width:335px; height:100px">


Note that the sprite picture reflects its rotation, if any. There are
three things that can be controlled here:

1\. The three circular buttons in a column at the left control the
sprite's *rotation* behavior. Sprite costumes are designed to be
right-side-up when the sprite is facing toward the right (direction =
90). If the topmost button is lit, the default as shown in the picture
above, then the sprite's costume rotates as the sprite changes
direction. If the middle button is selected, then the costume is
reversed left-right when the sprite's direction is roughly leftward
(direction between 180 and 359, or equivalently, between -180 and -1).
If the bottom button is selected, the costume's orientation does not
change regardless of the sprite's direction.

2\. The sprite's *name* can be changed in the text box that, in this
picture, says "Sprite."

3\. Finally, if the draggable checkbox is checked, then the user can move
the sprite on the stage by clicking and dragging it. The common use of
this feature is in game projects, in which some sprites are meant to be
under the player's control but others are not.
