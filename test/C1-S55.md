"Variables"; all the standard block colors are included.

See Appendix A (page 139) for more information.

The **crayon library** has only the crayon features,
without the rest of the colors package.

The catch errors library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image443.png" style="width:41px; height:15px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image444.png" style="width:292px; height:134px">
The safely try block allows you to handle
errors that happen when your program is run within the program, instead
of stopping the script with a red halo and an obscure error message. The
block runs the script in its first C-slot. If it finishes without an
error, nothing else happens. But if an error happens, the code in the
second C-slot is run. While that second script is running, the variable
contains the text of the error message that would have been displayed if
you weren't catching the error. The error block is sort of the opposite:
it lets your program *generate* an error message, which will be
displayed with a red halo unless it is caught by safely try. Safely try
reporting is the reporter version of safely try.

The text costumes library has only two blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image445.png" style="width:51px; height:20px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image446.png" style="width:184px; height:43px">
Costume from text reports a costume that
can be used with the switch to
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image447.png" style="width:313px; height:18px">
costume block to make a button:

Costume with background reports a costume made from another costume by
coloring its background, taking a color input like the set pen color to
RGB(A) block and a number of turtle steps of padding around the original
costume. These two blocks work together to make even better buttons:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image448.png" style="width:529px; height:65px">


The text to speech library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image449.png" style="width:218px; height:77px">
This library interfaces with a capability in up-to-date
browsers, so it might not work for you. It works best if the accent
matches the text!

The parallelization library contains these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image450.png" style="width:113px; height:121px">
The two do in parallel blocks take any
number of scripts as inputs. Those scripts will be run in parallel, like
ordinary independent scripts in the scripting area. The and wait version
waits until all of those scripts have finished before continuing the
script below the block.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image451.png" style="width:132px; height:142px">
The create variables library has these
blocks:

These blocks allow a program to perform the same operation as the

button, making global, sprite local, or script variables, but allowing
the program to compute the variable name(s). It can also set and find
the values of these variables, show and hide their stage watchers,
delete them, and find out if they already exist.

The getters and setters library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image452.png" style="width:180px; height:101px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image453.png" style="width:28px; height:16px">
The purpose of this library is to allow
program access to the settings controlled by user interface elements,
such as the settings menu. The setting block reports a setting; the set
flag block sets yes-or-no options that have checkboxes in the user
interface, while the set value block controls settings with numeric or
text values, such as project name.

Certain settings are ordinarily remembered on a per-user basis, such as
the "zoom blocks" value. But when these settings are changed by this
library, the change is in effect only while the project using the
library is loaded. No permanent changes are made. Note: this library has
not been converted for version 7.0, so you'll have to enable Javascript
extensions to use it.

The bignums, rationals, complex \#s library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image454.png" style="width:180px; height:149px">
The USE BIGNUMS block takes a Boolean input, to turn the
infinite precision feature on or off. When on, all of the arithmetic
operators are redefined to accept and report integers of any number of
digits (limited only by the memory of your computer) and, in fact, the
entire Scheme numeric tower, with exact rationals and with complex
numbers. The Scheme number block has a list of functions applicable to
Scheme numbers, including subtype predicates such as rational? and
infinite?, and selectors such as numerator and real-part.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image455.png" style="width:464px; height:40px">
The ! block computes the factorial
function, useful to test whether bignums are turned on. Without bignums:

With bignums:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image459.png" style="width:723px; height:35px">
The 375-digit value of 200! isn't
readable on this page, but if you right-click on the block and choose
"result pic," you can open the resulting picture in a browser window and
scroll through it. (These values end with a bunch of zero digits. That's
not roundoff error; the prime factors of 100! and 200! include many
copies of 2 and 5.) The block with no name is a way to enter things like
3/4 and 4+7i into numeric input slots by converting the slot to Any
type.

The strings, multi-line input library provides these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image463.png" style="width:378px; height:196px">
All of these could be written in Snap*!*
itself, but these are implemented using the corresponding JavaScript
library functions directly, so they run fast. They can be used, for
example, in scraping data from a web site. The command use
case-independent comparisons applies only to this library. The multiline
block accepts and reports a text input that can include newline
characters.

The animation library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image464.png" style="width:385px; height:224px">
Despite the name, this isn't only about graphics; you
can animate the values of a variable, or anything else that's expressed
numerically.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image465.png" style="width:93px; height:19px">
The central idea of this library is an
*easing function,* a reporter whose domain and range are real numbers
between 0 and 1 inclusive. The function represents what fraction of the
"distance" (in quotes because it might be any numeric value, such as
temperature in a simulation of weather) from here to there should be
covered in what fraction of the time. A linear easing function means
steady progression. A quadratic easing function means starting slowly
and accelerating. (Note that, since it's a requirement that *f*(0)=0 and
*f*(1)=1, there is only one linear easing function, *f*(*x*)=*x*, and
similarly for other categories.) The block reports some of the common
easing functions.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image466.png" style="width:445px; height:61px">
The two Motion blocks in this library
animate a sprite. Glide always animates the sprite's motion. Animate's
first pulldown menu input allows you to animate horizontal or vertical
motion, but will also animate the sprite's direction or size. The
animate block in Control lets you animate any numeric quantity with any
easing function. The getter and setter inputs are best explained by
example:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image467.png" style="width:327px; height:25px">
is equivalent to

The other blocks in the library are helpers for these four.

The serial ports library contains these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image468.png" style="width:166px; height:99px">
It is used to allow hardware developers to
control devices such as robots that are

connected to your computer via a serial port.

The frequency distribution analysis library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image469.png" style="width:387px; height:230px">


This is a collection of tools for analyzing large data sets and plotting
histograms of how often some value is found in some column of the table
holding the data.

The audio comp library includes these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image470.png" style="width:340px; height:286px">
This library takes a sound, one that you record or
one from our collection of sounds, and manipulates it by systematically
changing the intensity of the samples in the sound and by changing the
sampling rate at which the sound is reproduced. Many of the blocks are
helpers for the plot sound block, used to plot the waveform of a sound.
The play sound (primitive) block plays a sound. \_\_ Hz for reports a
sine wave as a list of samples.

The web services library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image471.png" style="width:327px; height:106px">
The first block is a generalization of the
primitive url block, allowing more control over the various options in
web requests: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and fine control over the
content of the message sent to the server. Current location reports your
latitude and longitude. Listify takes some text in JSON format (see page
54) and converts it to a structured list. Value at key looks up a
key-value pair in a (listified) JSON dictionary. The key:value: block is
just a constructor for an abstract data type used with the other blocks

The database library contains these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image472.png" style="width:217px; height:117px">
It is used to keep data that persist from
one Snap*!* session to the next, if you use the same browser and the
same login.

The world map library has these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image473.png" style="width:234px; height:327px">
Using any of the command blocks puts a map
on the screen, in a layer in front of the stage's background but behind
the pen trails layer (which is in turn behind all the sprites). The
first block asks your browser for your current physical location, for
which you may be asked to give permission. The next two blocks get and
set the map's zoom amount; the default zoom of 10 ﬁts from San Francisco
not quite down to Palo Alto on the screen. A zoom of 1 ﬁts almost the
entire world. A zoom of 3 fits the United States; a zoom of 5 ﬁts
Germany. The zoom can be changed in half steps, i.e., 5.5 is different
from 5, but 5.25 isn't.

The next five blocks convert between stage coordinates (pixels) and
Earth coordinates (latitude and longitude). The change by x: y: block
shifts the map relative to the stage. The distance to block measures the
map distance (in meters) between two sprites. The three reporters with
current in their names find *your* actual location, again supposing that
geolocation is enabled on your device. Update redraws the map; as
costume reports the visible section of the map as a costume. Set style
allows things like satellite pictures.

The APL primitives library contains these blocks:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image474.png" style="width:550px; height:107px">


<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image475.png" style="width:620px; height:196px">


For more information about APL, see Appendix B (page 148).

The <img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image476.png" style="width:115px; height:47px">
**list comprehension library** has one
block, zip. Its first input is a function of two inputs. The two
Any-type inputs are deep lists (lists of lists of...) interpreted as
trees, and the function is called with every possible combination of a
leaf node of the first tree and a leaf node of the second tree. But
instead of taking atoms (non-lists) as the leaves, zip allows the leaves
of each tree to be vectors (one-dimensional lists), matrices
(two-dimensional lists), etc. The Number-type inputs specify the leaf
dimension for each tree, so the function input might be called with a
vector from the first tree and an atom from the second tree.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image477.png" style="width:85px; height:145px">
The **bitwise library** provides bitwise logic
functions; each bit of the reported value is the result of applying the
corresponding Boolean function to the corresponding bits of the
input(s). The Boolean functions are not for ¬, and for ∧, or for ∨, and
xor (exclusive or) for ⊻. The remaining functions shift their first
input left or right by the number of bits given by the second input.
\<\< is left shift, \>\> is arithmetic right shift (shifting in one bits
from the left), and \>\>\> is logical right shift (shifting in zero bits
from the left). If you don't already know what these mean, find a
tutorial online.

The **MQTT library** supports the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
protocol, for connecting with IOT devices. See <https://mqtt.org/> for
more information.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image482.png" style="width:479px; height:277px">
The **Signada library** allows you to
control a microBit or similar device that works with the Signada
MicroBlocks project.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image486.png" style="width:325px; height:182px">


The **menus library** provides the ability to display hierarchical menus
on the stage, using the ask block's ability to take lists as inputs. See
page 24.

The **SciSnap*!* library** and the **TuneScope library** are too big to
discuss here and are documented separately at
<http://emu-online.de/ProgrammingWithSciSnap.pdf> and
<https://maketolearn.org/creating-art-animations-and-music/>
respectively.
