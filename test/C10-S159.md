The pause button suspends running all
scripts. If clicked while scripts are running, the button changes shape
to become a play button: Clicking it while in this form resumes the
suspended scripts. There is also a pause all block in the Control
palette that can be inserted in a script to suspend all scripts; this
provides the essence of a breakpoint debugging capability. The use of
the pause button is slightly different in visible stepping mode,
described in Chapter I.

The stop button stops all scripts, like
the stop all block. It does *not* prevent a script from starting again
in response to a click or keystroke; the user interface is always
active. There is one exception: generic when blocks will not fire after
a stop until some non-generic event starts a script. The stop button
also deletes all temporary clones.
