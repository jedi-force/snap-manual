Block Libraries

When you save a project (see Chapter II above), any custom blocks you've
made are saved with it. But sometimes you'd like to save a collection of
blocks that you expect to be useful in more than one project. Perhaps
your blocks implement a particular data structure (a stack, or a
dictionary, etc.), or they're the framework for building a multilevel
game. Such a collection of blocks is called a *block library.*

*\
*To create a block library, choose "Export blocks..." from the File
menu. You then see a window like this:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image522.png" style="width:194px; height:261px">
The window shows all of your global custom
blocks. You can uncheck some of the checkboxes to select exactly which
blocks you want to include in your library. (You can right-click or
control-click on the export window for a menu that lets you check or
uncheck all the boxes at once.) Then press OK. An XML file containing
the blocks will appear in your Downloads location.

To import a block library, use the "Import..." command in the File menu,
or just drag the XML file into the Snap*!* window.

Several block libraries are included with Snap*!*; for details about
them, see page 25.
