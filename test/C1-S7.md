### Inter-Sprite Communication with Broadcast

Earlier we saw an example of two sprites moving at the same time. In a
more interesting program, though, the sprites on stage will *interact*
to tell a story, play a game, etc. Often one sprite will have to tell
another sprite to run a script. Here's a simple example:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image40.png" style="width:165px; height:24px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image41.png" style="width:55px; height:107px">

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image42.png" style="width:267px; height:145px">

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image43.png" style="width:119px; height:83px">

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image44.png" style="width:146px; height:58px">


<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image45.png" style="width:172px; height:19px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image46.png" style="width:173px; height:18px">
In the block, the word "bark" is just an
arbitrary name I made up. When you click on the downward arrowhead in
that input slot, one of the choices (the only choice, the first time) is
"new," which then prompts you to enter a name for the new broadcast.
When this block is run, the chosen message is sent to *every* sprite,
which is why the block is called "broadcast." (But if you click the
right arrow after the message name, the block becomes , and you can
change it to Â to send the message just to one sprite.) In this program,
though, only one sprite has a script to run when that broadcast is sent,
namely the dog. Because the boy's script uses broadcast and wait rather
than just broadcast, the boy doesn't go on to his next say block until
the dog's script finishes. That's why the two sprites take turns
talking, instead of both talking at once. In Chapter VII,
