 Functional and Imperative List Programming
------------------------------------------

 There are two ways to create a list inside a
program. Scratch users will be familiar with the *imperative*
programming style, which is based on a set of command blocks that modify
a list:

As an example, here are two blocks that take a list of numbers as input,
and report a new list containing only the even numbers from the original
list:[^4]

or

In this script, we first create a temporary variable, then put an empty
list in it, then go through the items of the input list using the add
**...** to (result) block to modify the result list, adding one item at
a time, and finally report the result.

*Functional* programming is a different
approach that is becoming important in "real world" programming because
of parallelism, i.e., the fact that different processors can be
manipulating the same data at the same time. This makes the use of
mutation (changing the value associated with a variable, or the items of
a list) problematic because with parallelism it's impossible to know the
exact sequence of events, so the result of mutation may not be what the
programmer expected. Even without parallelism, though, functional
programming is sometimes a simpler and more effective technique,
especially when dealing with recursively defined data structures. It
uses reporter blocks, not command blocks, to build up a list value:

In a functional program, we often use recursion to construct a list, one
item at a time. The in front of block makes a list that has one item
added to the front of an existing list, *without changing the value of
the original list.* A nonempty list is processed by dividing it into its
first item (item 1 of) and all the rest of the items (all but first of),
which are handled through a recursive call:

Snap*!* uses two different internal
representations of lists, one (dynamic array) for imperative programming
and the other (linked list) for functional programming. Each
representation makes the corresponding built-in list blocks (commands or
reporters, respectively) most efficient. It's possible to mix styles in
the same program, but if *the same list* is used both ways, the program
will run more slowly because it converts from one representation to the
other repeatedly. (The item ( ) of \[ \] block doesn't change the
representation.) You don't have to know the details of the internal
representations, but it's worthwhile to use each list in a consistent
way.
