Tool Bar Features
-----------------

Holding down the Shift key while clicking on any of the menu buttons
gives access to an extended menu with options, shown in red, that are
experimental or for use by the developers. We're not listing those extra
options here because they change frequently and you shouldn't rely on
them. But they're not secrets.

### The Snap*!* Logo Menu

The Snap*!* logo at the left end of the tool bar is clickable. It shows
a menu of options about Snap*!* itself:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image988.png" style="width:224px; height:98px">


The About option displays information about Snap*!* itself, including
version numbers for the source modules, the implementors, and the
license (AGPL: you can do anything with it except create proprietary
versions, basically).

The Reference manual option downloads a copy of the latest revision of
this manual in PDF format.

The Snap! website option opens a browser window pointing to
snap.berkeley.edu, the web site for Snap*!*.

The Download source option opens a browser window displaying the Github
repository of the source files for Snap*!*. At the bottom of the page
are links to download the latest official release. Or you can navigate
around the site to find the current development version. You can read
the code to learn how Snap*!* is implemented, host a copy on your own
computer (this is one way to keep working while on an airplane), or make
a modified version with customized features. (However, access to cloud
accounts is limited to the official version hosted at Berkeley.)

### The File Menu

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image384.png" style="width:31px; height:17px">
The file icon shows a menu mostly about
saving and loading projects. You may not see all these options, if you
don't have multiple sprites, scenes, custom blocks, and custom
categories.

The Notes option opens a window in which you can type notes about the
project: How to use it, what it does, whose project you modified to
create it, if any, what other sources of ideas you used, or any other
information about the project. This text is saved with the project, and
is useful if you share it with other users.

The New option starts a new, empty project. Any project you were working
on before disappears, so you are asked to confirm that this is really
what you want. (It disappears only from the current working Snap*!*
window; you should save the current project, if you want to keep it,
before using New.)

Note the \^N at the end of the line. This indicates that you can type
control-N as a shortcut for this menu item. Alas, this is not the case
in every browser. Some Mac browsers require command-N (âŒ˜N) instead,
while others open a new browser window instead of a new project. You'll
have to experiment. In general, the keyboard shortcuts in Snap*!* are
the standard ones you expect in other software.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image989.png" style="width:277px; height:201px">
The Open... option shows a project open
dialog box in which you can choose a project to open:

In this dialog, the three large buttons at the left select a source of
projects: Cloud means your Snap*!* account's cloud storage. Examples
means a collection of sample projects we provide. Computer is for
projects saved on your own computer; when you click it, this dialog is
replaced with your computer's system dialog for opening files. The text
box to the right of those buttons is an alphabetical listing of projects
from that source; selecting a project by clicking shows its thumbnail (a
picture of the stage when it was saved) and its project notes at the
right.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image990.png" style="width:262px; height:190px">
The search bar at the top can be used to
find a project by name or text in the project notes. So in this example:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image991.png" style="width:261px; height:190px">
I was looking for my ice cream projects
and typed "crea" in the search bar, then wondered why "ferris" matched.
But then when I clicked on ferris I saw this:

My search matched the word "re*crea*te" in the project notes.

The six buttons at the bottom select an action to perform on the
selected project. In the top row, Recover looks in your cloud account
for older versions of the chosen project. ***If your project is damaged,
don't keep saving broken versions! Use Recover first thing.*** You will
see a list of saved versions; choose one to open it. Typically, you'll
see the most recent version before the last save, and the newest version
saved before today. Then come buttons Share/Unshare and
Publish/Unpublish. The labelling of the buttons depends on your
project's publication status. If a project is neither shared nor
published (the ones in lightface type in the project list), it is
private and nobody can see it except you, its owner. If it is shared
(boldface in the project list), then when you open it you'll see a URL
like this one:

https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html\#present:Username=bh&ProjectName=count%20change

but with your username and project name. ("%20" in the project name
represents a space, which can't be part of a URL.) Anyone who knows this
URL can see your project. Finally, if your project is ***published***
(***bold italic*** in the list), then your project is shown on the
Snap*!* web site for all the world to see. (In all of these cases, you
are the only one who can *write* to (save) your project. If another user
saves it, a separate copy will be saved in that user's account. Projects
remember the history of who created the original version and any other
"remix" versions along the way.

In the second row, the first button, Open, loads the project into
Snap*!* and closes the dialog box. The next button (if Cloud is the
source) is Delete, and if clicked it deletes the selected project.
Finally, the Cancel button closes the dialog box without opening a
project. (It does not undo any sharing, unsharing, or deletion you've
done.)

Back to the File menu, the Save menu option saves the project to the
same source and same name that was used when opening the project. (If
you opened another user's shared project or an example project, the
project will be saved to your own cloud account. You must be logged in
to save to the cloud.)

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image992.png" style="width:311px; height:226px">
The Save as... menu option opens a dialog
box in which you can specify where to save the project:

This is much like the Open dialog, except for the horizontal text box at
the top, into which you type a name for the project. You can also
publish, unpublish, share, unshare, and delete projects from here. There
is no Recover button.

The Import... menu option is for bringing some external resource into
the current project, or it can load an entirely separate project, from
your local disk. You can import costumes (any picture format that your
browser supports), sounds (again, any format supported by your browser),
and block libraries or sprites (XML format, previously exported from
Snap*!* itself). Imported costumes and sounds will belong to the
currently selected sprite; imported blocks are global (for all sprites).
Using the Import option is equivalent to dragging the file from your
desktop onto the Snap*!* window.

Depending on your browser, the Export project... option either directly
saves to your disk or opens a new browser tab containing your complete
project in XML notation (a plain text format). You can then use the
browser's Save feature to save the project as an XML file, which should
be named *something*.xml so that Snap*!* will recognize it as a project
when you later drag it onto a Snap*!* window. This is an alternative to
saving the project to your cloud account: keeping it on your own
computer. It is equivalent to choosing Computer from the Save dialog
described earlier.

The Export summary... option creates a web page, in HTML, with all of
the information about your project: its name, its project notes, a
picture of what's on its stage, definitions of global blocks, and then
per-sprite information: name, wardrobe (list of costumes), and local
variables and block definitions. The page can be converted to PDF by the
browser; it's intended to meet the documentation requirements of the
Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles create task.

The Export blocks... option is used to create a block library. It
presents a list of all the global (for all sprites) blocks in your
project, and lets you select which to export. It then opens a browser
tab with those blocks in XML format, or stores directly to your local
disk, as with the Export project option. Block libraries can be imported
with the Import option or by dragging the file onto the Snap*!* window.
This option is shown only if you have defined custom blocks.

The Unused blocks... option presents a listing of all the global custom
blocks in your project that aren't used anywhere, and offers to delete
them. As with Export blocks, you can choose a subset to delete with
checkboxes. This option is shown only if you have defined custom blocks.

The Hide blocks... option shows *all* blocks, including primitives, with
checkboxes. This option does not remove any blocks from your project,
but it does hide selected block in your palette. The purpose of the
option is to allow teachers to present students with a simplified
Snap*!* with some features effectively removed. The hiddenness of
primitives is saved with each project, so students can load a shared
project and see just the desired blocks. But users can always unhide
blocks by choosing this option and unclicking all the checkboxes.
(Right-click in the background of the dialog box to get a menu from
which you can check all boxes or uncheck all boxes.)

The New category... option allows you to add your own categories to the
palette. It opens a dialog box in which you specify a name *and a color*
for the category. (A lighter version of the same color will be used for
the zebra coloring feature.)

The Remove a category... option appears only if you've created custom
categories. It opens a very small, easy-to-miss menu of category names
just under the file icon in the menu bar. If you remove a category that
has blocks in it, all those blocks are also removed.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image993.png" style="width:112px; height:19px">
The next group of options concern the
*scenes* feature, new in Snap*!* 7.0. A scene is a complete project,
with its own stage, sprites, and code, but several can be merged into
one project, using the block to bring another scene onscreen. The
Scenes... option presents a menu of all the scenes in your project,
where the File menu was before you clicked it. The New scene option
creates a new, empty scene, which you can rename as you like from its
context menu. Add scene... is like Import... but for scenes. (A complete
project can be imported as a scene into another project, so you have to
specify that you're importing the project *as a scene* rather than
replacing the current project.)

The Libraries... option presents a menu of useful, optional block
libraries:<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image385.png" style="width:711px; height:311px">


When you click on the one-line description of a library, you are shown
the actual blocks in the library and a longer explanation of its
purpose. You can browse the libraries to find one that will satisfy your
needs. The libraries are described in detail in Section I.H, page 25.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image994.png" style="width:411px; height:311px">
The Costumes... option opens a browser
into the costume library:

You can import a single costume by clicking it and then clicking the
Import button. Alternatively, you can import more than one costume by
double-clicking each one, and then clicking Cancel when done. Notice
that some costumes are tagged with "svg" in this picture; those are
vector-format costumes that are not (yet) editable within Snap*!*.

If you have the stage selected in the sprite corral, rather than a
sprite, the Costumes... option changes to a Backgrounds... option, with
different choices in the browser:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image995.png" style="width:411px; height:311px">
The costume and background libraries
include both bitmap (go jagged if enlarged) and vector (enlarge
smoothly) images. Thanks to Scratch 2.0/3.0 for most of these images!
Some older browsers refuse to import a vector image, but instead convert
it to bitmap.

The Sounds... option opens the third kind of media browser:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image996.png" style="width:411px; height:311px">
The Play buttons can be used to preview
the sounds.

Finally, the Undelete sprites... option appears only if you have deleted
a sprite; it allows you to recover a sprite that was deleted by accident
(perhaps intending to delete only a costume).

### The Cloud Menu

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image997.png" style="width:138px; height:73px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image998.png" style="width:28px; height:16px">
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image489.png" style="width:64px; height:16px">
The cloud icon shows a menu of options
relating to your Snap*!* cloud account. If you are not logged in, you
see the outline icon and get this menu:

Choose Login... if you have a Snap*!* account and remember your
password. Choose Signup... if you don't have an account. Choose Reset
Password... if you've forgotten your password or just want to change it.
You will then get an email, at the address you gave when you created
your account, with a new temporary password. Use that password to log
in, then you can choose your own password, as shown below. Choose Resend
Verification Email... if you have just created a Snap*!* account but
can't find the email we sent you with the link to verify that it's
really your email. (If you still can't find it, check your spam folder.
If you are using a school email address, your school may block incoming
email from outside the school.) The Open in Community Site option
appears only if you have a project open; it takes you to the community
site page about that project.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1001.png" style="width:155px; height:63px">
If you are already logged in, you'll see
the solid icon
<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1002.png" style="width:28px; height:16px">
 and get this menu:

Logout is obvious, but has the additional benefit of showing you who's
logged in. Change password... will ask for your old password (the
temporary one if you're resetting your password) and the new password
you want, entered twice because it doesn't echo. Open in Community Site
is the same as above.
