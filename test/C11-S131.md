### The Paint Editor

Here is a picture of a Paint Editor window:

If you've used any painting program, most of this will be familiar to
you. Currently, costumes you import can be edited only if they are in a
bitmap format (png, jpeg, gif, etc.). There is a vector editor, but it
works only for creating a costume, not editing an imported vector (svg)
picture. Unlike the case of the Block Editor, only one Paint Editor
window can be open at a time.

The ten square buttons in two rows of five near the top left of the
window are the *tools.* The top row, from left to right, are the
paintbrush tool, the outlined rectangle tool, the outlined ellipse tool,
the eraser tool, and the rotation point tool. The bottom row tools are
the line drawing tool, the solid rectangle tool, the solid ellipse tool,
the floodfill tool, and the eyedropper tool. Below the tools is a row of
four buttons that immediately change the picture. The first two change
its overall size; the next two flip the picture around horizontally or
vertically. Below these are a color palette, a greyscale tape, and
larger buttons for black, white, and transparent paint. Below these is a
solid bar displaying the currently selected color. Below that is a
picture of a line showing the brush width for painting and drawing, and
below that, you can set the width either with a slider or by typing a
number (in pixels) into the text box. Finally, the checkbox constrains
the line tool to draw horizontally or vertically, the rectangle tools to
draw squares, and the ellipse tools to draw circles. You can get the
same effect temporarily by holding down the shift key, which makes a
check appear in the box as long as you hold it down. (But the Caps Lock
key doesn't affect it.)

You can correct errors with the undo button, which removes the last
thing you drew, or the clear button, which erases the entire picture.
(Note, it does *not* revert to what the costume looked like before you
started editing it! If that's what you want, click the Cancel button at
the bottom of the editor.) When you're finished editing, to keep your
changes, click OK.

Note that the ellipse tools work more intuitively than ones in other
software you may have used. Instead of dragging between opposite corners
of the rectangle circumscribing the ellipse you want, so that the
endpoints of your dragging have no obvious connection to the actual
shape, in Snap*!* you start at the center of the ellipse you want and
drag out to the edge. When you let go of the button, the mouse cursor
will be on the curve. If you drag out from the center at 45 degrees to
the axes, the resulting curve will be a circle; if you drag more
horizontally or vertically, the ellipse will be more eccentric. (Of
course if you want an exact circle you can hold down the shift key or
check the checkbox.) The rectangle tools, though, work the way you
expect: You start at one corner of the desired rectangle and drag to the
opposite corner.

Using the eyedropper tool, you can click anywhere in the Snap*!* window,
even outside the Paint Editor, and the tool will select the color at the
mouse cursor for use in the Paint Editor. You can only do this once,
because the Paint Editor automatically selects the paintbrush when you
choose a color. (Of course you can click on the eyedropper tool button
again.)

The only other non-obvious tool is the rotation point tool. It shows in
the Paint Editor where the sprite's current rotation center is (the
point around which it turns when you use a turn block); if you click or
drag in the picture, the rotation point will move where you click.
(You'd want to do this, for example, if you want a character to be able
to wave its arm, so you use two sprites connected together. You want the
rotation point of the arm sprite to be at the end where it joins the
body, so it remains attached to the shoulder while waving.)

The vector editor's controls are much like
those in the bitmap editor. One point of difference is that the bitmap
editor has two buttons for solid and outline rectangles, and similarly
for ellipses, but in the vector editor there is always an edge color and
a fill color, even if the latter is "transparent paint," and so only one
button per shape is needed. Since each shape that you draw is a separate
layer (like sprites on the stage), there are controls to move the
selected shape up (frontward) or down (rearward) relative to other
shapes. There is a selection tool to drag out a rectangular area and
select all the shapes within that area.
