### Media Computation with Sounds {#media-computation-with-sounds .ListParagraph}

The starting point for computation with sound is the microphone block.
It starts by recording a brief burst of sound from your microphone. (How
brief? On my computer, 0.010667 seconds, but you'll see shortly how to
Ô¨Ånd out or control the sample size on your computer.)

Just as the *pixel* is the smallest piece
of a picture, the *sample* is the smallest piece of a sound. It says
here: that on my computer, 48,000 samples are recorded per second, so
each sample is 1/48,000 of a second. The value of a sample is between -1
and 1, and represents the sound pressure on the microphone---how hard
the air is pushing---at that instant. (You can skip the next page or so
if you know about Fourier analysis.) Here's a picture of 400 samples:

In this graph, the *x* axis represents the time at which each sample was
measured; the *y* axis measures the value of the sample at that time.
The first obvious thing about this graph is that it has a lot of ups and
downs. The most basic up-and-down function is the *sine wave:*

Every periodic function (more or less, any sample that sounds like music
rather than sounding like static) is composed of a sum of sine waves of
different frequencies.

Look back at the graph of our sampled sound. There is a green dot every
seven samples. There's nothing magic about the number seven; I tried
different values until I found one that looked right. What "right" means
is that, for the first few dots at least, they coincide almost perfectly
with the high points and low points of the graph. Near the middle
(horizontally) of the graph, the green dots don't seem anywhere near the
high and low points, but if you find the very lowest point of the graph,
about 2/3 of the way along, the dots start lining up almost perfectly
again.

The red graph above shows two *cycles* of a sine wave. One cycle goes
up, then down, then up again. The amount of time taken for one cycle is
the *period* of the sine function. If the green dots match both ups and
downs in the captured sound, then two dots---14 samples, or 14/48000 of
a second---represent the period. The first cycle and a half of the graph
looks like it could be a pure sine wave, but after that, the tops and
bottoms don't line up, and there are peculiar little jiggles, such as
the one before the fifth green dot. This happens because sine waves of
different periods are added together.

It turns out to be more useful to measure the reciprocal of the period,
in our case, 48000/14 or about 3429 *cycles per second.* Another name
for "cycles per second" is "Hertz," abbreviated Hz, so our sound has a
component at 3249 Hz. As a musical note, that's about an A (a little
flat), four octaves above middle C. (Don't worry too much about the note
being a little off; remember that the 14-sample period was just
eyeballed and is unlikely to be exactly right.)

Four octaves above middle C is really high! That would be a
shrill-sounding note. But remember that a complex waveform is the sum of
multiple sine waves at different frequency. Here's a different
up-and-down regularity:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image829.png" style="width:267px; height:101px">
It's not obvious, but in the left part of
the graph, the signal is more above the *x* axis than below it. Toward
the right, it seems to be more below than above the axis. At the very
right it looks like it might be climbing again.

The period of the red sine wave is 340 samples, or 340/48000 second.
That's a frequency of about 141 Hz, about D below middle C. Again, this
is measuring by eyeball, but likely to be close to the right frequency.

All this eyeballing doesn't seem very scientific. Can't we just get the
computer to find all the relevant frequencies? Yes, we can, using a
mathematical technique called *Fourier analysis.* (Jean-Baptiste Joseph
Fourier, 1768--1830, made many contributions to mathematics and physics,
but is best known for working out the nature of periodic functions as a
sum of sine waves.) Luckily we don't have to do the math; the microphone
block will do it for us, if we ask for microphone spectrum:

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image830.png" style="width:719px; height:143px">
These are frequency spectra from (samples
of) three different songs. The most obvious thing about these graphs is
that their overall slope is downward; the loudest frequency is the
lowest frequency. That's typical of music.

The next thing to notice is that there's a regularity in the spacing of
spikes in the graph. This is partly just an artifact; the frequency
(horizontal) axis isn't continuous. There are a finite number of
"buckets" (default: 512), and all the frequencies within a bucket
contribute to the amplitude (vertical axis) of that bucket. The spectrum
is a list of that many amplitudes. But the patterns of alternating
rising and falling values are real; the frequencies that are multiples
of the main note being sampled will have higher amplitude than other
frequencies.

Samples and spectrum are the two most detailed representations of a
sound. But the microphone block has other, simpler options also:

volume the instantaneous volume when the block is called

note the MIDI note number (as in play note) of the main note heard

frequency the frequency in Hz of the main note heard

sample rate the number of samples being collected per second

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image258.png" style="width:280px; height:27px">
resolution the size of the array in which data are
collected (typically 512, must be a power of 2)

The block for sounds that corresponds to new picture for pictures is

Its first input is a list of samples, and its second input specifies how
many samples occupy one second.
