 Prototyping: Parents and Children

Most current OOP languages use a *class/instance* approach to creating
objects. A class is a particular *kind of object,* and an instance is an
*actual object* of that type. For example, there might be a Dog class,
and several instances Fido, Spot, and Runt. The class typically
specifies the methods shared by all dogs (RollOver, SitUpAndBeg, Fetch,
and so on), and the instances contain data such as species, color, and
friendliness. Snap*!* uses a different approach called *prototyping,* in
which there is no distinction between classes and instances. Prototyping
is better suited to an experimental, tinkering style of work: You make a
single dog sprite, with both methods (blocks) and data (variables); you
can actually watch it and interact with it on the stage; and when you
like it, you use it as the prototype from which to clone other dogs. If
you later discover a bug in the behavior of dogs, you can edit a method
in the parent, and all of the children will automatically share the new
version of the method block. Experienced class/instance programmers may
find prototyping strange at first, but it is actually a more expressive
system, because you can easily simulate a class/instance hierarchy by
hiding the prototype sprite! Prototyping is also a better fit with the
Scratch design principle that everything in a project should be concrete
and visible on the stage; in class/instance OOP the programming process
begins with an abstract, invisible entity, the class, that must be
designed before any concrete objects can be made.[^7]

There are three ways to make a child
sprite. If you control-click or right-click on a sprite in the "sprite
corral" at the bottom right corner of the window, you get a menu that
includes "clone" as one of the choices. There is an a new clone of block
in the Control palette that creates and reports a child sprite. And
sprites have a "parent" attribute that can be set, like any attribute,
thereby *changing* the parent of an existing sprite.

 Inheritance by Delegation

A clone *inherits* properties of its parent. "Properties" include
scripts, custom blocks, variables, named lists, system attributes,
costumes, and sounds. Each individual property can be shared between
parent and child, or not shared (with a separate one in the child). The
getter block for a shared property, in the child's palette, is displayed
in a lighter color; separate properties of the child are displayed in
the traditional colors.

> clone is given a random position. Another is that *temporary* clones
> share the scripts in their parent's scripting area. A third is that
> sprite-local variables that the parent creates *after* cloning are

The rules are full of details, but the basic idea is simple: Parents can
change their children, but children can't directly change their parents.
That's what you'd expect from the word "inherit": the influence just
goes in one direction. When a child changes some property, it's
declaring independence from its parent (with respect to that one
property). What if you really want the child to be able to make a change
in the parent (and therefore in itself and all its siblings)? Remember
that in this system any object can tell any other object to do
something:

When a sprite gets a message for which it
doesn't have a corresponding block, the message is *delegated* to that
sprite's parent. When a sprite does have the corresponding block, then
the message is not delegated. If the script that implements a delegated
message refers to my (self), it means the child to which the message was
originally sent, not the parent to which the message was delegated.

List of attributes

At the right is a picture of the dropdown
menu of attributes in the my block.

Several of these are not real attributes, but things related to
attributes:

-   self: this sprite

-   neighbors: a list of *nearby* sprites[^8]

-   other sprites: a list of all sprites except myself

-   stage: the stage, which is first-class, like a sprite

-   clones: a list of my *temporary* clones

-   other clones: a list of my *temporary* siblings

-   parts: a list of sprites whose anchor attribute is this sprite

-   children: a list of all my clones, temporary and permanent

The others are individual attributes:

-   anchor: the sprite of which I am a (nested) part

-   parent: the sprite of which I am a clone

-   temporary?: am I a temporary clone?

-   name: my name (same as parent's name if I'm temporary)

-   costumes: a list of the sprite's costumes

-   sounds: a list of the sprite's sounds

-   blocks: a list of the blocks visible in this sprite

-   categories: a list of all the block category names

-   dangling?: True if I am a part and not in synchronous orbit

-   draggable?: True if the user can move me with the mouse

-   width, height, left, right, top, bottom: The width or height of my
    costume *as seen right now,* or the left, etc., edge of my bounding
    box, taking rotation into account.

-   rotation x, rotation y: when reading with my, the same as x
    position, y position. When set, changes the sprite's rotation center
    *without moving the sprite,* like dragging the rotation center in
    the paint editor.

-   center x, center y: the x and y position of the center of my

> bounding box, rounded oﬀ--the geometric center of the costume.
