### Recursive Calls to Multiple-Input Blocks

A relatively rare situation not yet considered here is the case of a
recursive block that has a variable number of inputs. Let's say the user
of your project calls your block with five inputs one time, and 87
inputs another time. How do you write the recursive call to your block
when you don't know how many inputs to give it? The answer is that you
collect the inputs in a list (recall that, when you declare an input
name to represent a variable number of inputs, your block sees those
inputs as a list of values in the first place), and then, in the
recursive call, you drop that input list *onto the arrowheads* that
indicate a variable-input slot, rather than onto the input slot:

\
Note that the halo you see while dragging onto the arrowheads is red
instead of white, and covers the input slot as well as the arrowheads.
And when you drop the expression onto the arrowheads, the words "input
list:" are added to the block text and the arrowheads disappear (in this
invocation only) to remind you that the list represents all of the
multiple inputs, not just a single input. The items in the list are
taken *individually* as inputs to the script. Since numbers is a list of
numbers, each individual item is a number, just what sizes wants. This

block will take any number of numbers as
inputs, and will make the sprite grow and shrink accordingly:

The user of this block calls it with any number of
*individual numbers* as inputs. But inside the definition of the block,
all of those numbers form *a* *list* that has a single input name,
numbers. This recursive definition ﬁrst checks to make sure there are
any inputs at all. If so, it processes the ﬁrst input (item 1 of the
list), then it wants to make a recursive call with all but the ﬁrst
number. But sizes doesn't take a list as input; it takes numbers as
inputs! So this would be wrong:
