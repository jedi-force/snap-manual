###  Mixing Colors

Given first class colors, the next question is, what operations apply to
them, the way arithmetic operators apply to numbers and higher order
functions apply to lists? The equivalent to adding numbers is mixing
colors, but unfortunately there isn't a simple answer to what that
means.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1201.png" style="width:417px; height:54px">The easiest kind of color mixing to understand is
*additive* mixing, which is what happens when you shine two colored
lights onto a (white) wall. It's also what happens in your computer
screen, where each dot (pixel) of an image is created by a tiny red
light, a tiny green light, and a tiny blue light that can be combined at
different strengths to make different colors. Essentially, additive
mixing of two colors is computed by adding the two red components, the
two green components, and the two blue components. It's not *quite* that
simple only because each component of the result must be in the range 0
to 255. So, red (255, 0, 0) mixed with green (0, 255, 0) gives (255,
255, 0), which is yellow. But red (255, 0, 0) plus yellow (255, 255, 0)
can't give (510, 255, 0). Just limiting the red in the result to 255
would mean that red plus yellow is yellow, which doesn't make sense.
Instead, if the red value has to be reduced by half (from 510 to 255),
then *all three* values must be reduced by half, so the result is (255,
128, 0), which is orange. (Half of 255 is 127.5, but each RGB value must
be an integer.)

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1205.png" style="width:431px; height:53px">A different kind of color mixing based on light is done
when different colored transparent plastic sheets are held in front of a
white light, as is done in theatrical lighting. In that situation, the
light that gets through both filters is what remains after some light is
filtered out by the first one and some of what's left is filtered out by
the second one. In red-green-blue terms, a red filter filters out green
and blue; a yellow filter allows red and green through, filtering out
blue. But there isn't any green light for the yellow filter to pass; it
was filtered out by the red filter. Each filter can only remove light,
not add light, so this is called *subtractive* mixing:

Perhaps confusingly, the numerical computation of subtractive mixing is
done by *multiplying* the RGB values, taken as fractions of the maximum
255, so red (1, 0, 0) times yellow (1, 1, 0) is red again.

Those are both straightforward to compute. Much, much more complicated
is trying to simulate the result of mixing *paints.* It's not just that
we'd have to compute a more complicated function of the red, green, and
blue values; it's that RGB values (or any other three-dimensional color
space) are inadequate to describe the behavior of paints. Two paints can
look identical, and have the same RGB values, but may still behave very
differently when mixed with other colors. The differences are mostly due
to the chemistry of the paints, but are also affected by exactly how the
colors are mixed. The mixing is mostly subtractive; red paint *absorbs*
most of the colors other than red, so what's reflected off the surface
is whatever isn't absorbed by the colors being mixed. But there can be
an additive component also.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1209.gif" style="width:720px; height:84px">The proper mathematical abstraction to describe a paint
is a *reflectance* graph, like this:

(These aren't paints, but minerals, and one software-generated spectrum,
from the US Geological Survey's [Spectral
Library](https://www.usgs.gov/labs/spec-lab/capabilities/spectral-library).
The details don't matter, just the fact that a graph like these gives
much more information than three RGB numbers.) To mix two paints
properly, you multiply the *y* values (as fractions) at each matching
*x* coordinate of the two graphs.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1221.png" style="width:444px; height:55px"> Having said all that, the mix block takes
the colors it is given as inputs and converts them into what we hope are
*typical* paint reflectance spectra that would look like those colors,
and then mixes those spectra and converts back to RGB.

But unlike the other two kinds of mixing, in this case we can't say that
these colors are "the right answer"; what would happen with real paints
depends on their chemical composition and how they're mixed. There are
three more mixing options, but these three are the ones that correspond
to real-world color mixing.

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1225.png" style="width:417px; height:63px">The mix block will accept any number of
colors, and will mix them in equal proportion. If (for any kind of
mixing) you want more of one color than another, use the color at weight
block to make a "weighted color":

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1226.png" style="width:496px; height:41px">This mixes four parts red paint to one
part green paint. All colors in a mixture can be weighted:
