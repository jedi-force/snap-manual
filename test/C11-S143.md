several tools for manipulating color. Although its main purpose is
controlling a sprite's pen color, it also establishes colors as a first
class data type:

projects without having to be color experts, we provide two simple
mechanisms: a *color number* scale with a broad range of continuous
color variation and a set of 100 *crayons* organized by color family
(ten reds, ten oranges, etc.) The crayons include the block colors:

X11/W3C names, and variants on those scales.
