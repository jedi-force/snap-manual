### Perceptual Spaces: HSV and HSL

<img src="/snap-manual/assets/images/image1193.png" style="width:71px; height:69px">
RGB is the right way to think about colors
if you're building or programming a display monitor; CMYK is the right
way if you're building or programming a color printer. But neither of
those coordinate systems is very intuitive if you're trying to
understand what color *you see* if, for example, you mix 37% red light,
52% green, and 11% blue. The *hue* scale is one dimension of most
attempts at a perceptual scale. The square at the right has pale blues
along the top edge, dark blues along the right edge, various shades of
gray toward the left, black at the bottom, and pure spectral blue in the
top right corner. Although no other point in the square is pure blue,
you can tell at a glance that no other spectral color is mixed with the
blue.

Aside from hue, the other two dimensions
of a color space have to represent how much white and/or black is mixed
with the spectral color. (Bear in mind that "mixing black" is a metaphor
when it comes to monitors. There really is black paint, but there's no
such thing as black light.) One such space, HSV, has one dimension for
the amount of color (vs. white), called *saturation,* and one for the
amount of black, imaginatively called *value.* HSV stands for
Hue-Saturation-Value. (Value is also called *brightness.*) The *value*
is actually measured backward from the above description; that is, if
value is 0, the color is pure black; if value is 100, then a saturation
of 0 means all white, no spectral color; a saturation of 100 means no
white at all. In the square in the previous paragraph, the *x* axis is
the saturation and the *y* axis is the value. The entire bottom edge is
black, but only the top left corner is white. HSV is the traditional
color space used in Scratch and Snap*!.* Set pen color set the hue; set
pen shade set the value. There was originally no Pen block to set the
saturation, but there's a set brightness effect Looks block to control
the saturation of the sprite's costume. (I speculate that the Scratch
designers, like me, thought tints were less vivid than shades against a
white background, so they made it harder to control tinting.)

But if you're looking at colors on a
computer display, HSV isn't really a good match for human perception.
Intuitively, black and white should be treated symmetrically. This is
the HSL (hue-saturation-lightness) color space. *Saturation,* in HSL, is
a measure of the *grayness* or *dullness* of a color (how close it comes
to being on a black-and-white scale) and *lightness* measures
*spectralness* with pure white at one end, pure black at the other end,
and spectral color in the middle. The *saturation* number is actually
the opposite of grayness: 0 means pure gray, and 100 means pure spectral
color, provided that the *lightness* is 50, midway between black and
white. Colors with lightness other than 50 have some black or white
mixed in, but saturation 100 means that the color is as fully saturated
as it can be, given the amount of white or black needed to achieve that
lightness. Saturation less than 100 means that *both white and black*
are mixed with the spectral color. (Such mixtures are called *tones* of
the spectral color. Perceptually, colors with saturation 100% don't look
gray: but colors with saturation 75% do:

Note that HSV and HSL both have a dimension called "saturation," but
*they're not the same thing!* In HSV, "saturation" means non-whiteness,
whereas in HSL it means non-grayness (vividness).

More fine print: It's misleading to talk about the spectrum of light
wavelengths as if it were the same as perceived hue. If your computer
display is showing you a yellow area, for example, it's doing it by
turning on its red and green LEDs over that area, and what hits your
retina *is still two wavelengths of light, red and green, superimposed.*
You could make what's perceptually the same yellow by using a single
intermediate wavelength. Your eye and brain don't distinguish between
those two kinds of yellow. Also, your brain automatically adjusts
perceived hue to correct for differences in illumination. When you place
a monochrome object so that it's half in sunlight and half in the shade,
you see it as one even though what's reaching your eyes from the two
regions differs a lot. And, sadly, it's HSL whose use of "saturation"
disagrees with the official international color vocabulary
standardization committee. I learned all this from [this
tutorial](http://www.huevaluechroma.com/011.php), which you might find
more coherent than jumping around Wikipedia if you're interested.

Although traditional Scratch and Snap*!*
use HSV in programs, they use HSL in the color picker. The horizontal
axis is hue (fair hue, in this version) and the vertical axis is
*lightness,* the scale with black at one end and white at the other end.
It would make no sense to have only the bottom half of this selector
(HSV Value) or only the top half (HSV Saturation). And, given that you
can only fit two dimensions on a flat screen, it makes sense to pick HSL
saturation (vividness) as the one to keep at 100%. (In this fair-hue
picker, some colors appear twice: "spectral" (50% lightness) browns as
shades (â‰ˆ33% lightness) of red or orange, and shades of those browns.)

Software that isn't primarily about
colors (so, *not* including Photoshop, for example) typically use HSV or
HSL, with web-based software more likely to use HSV because that's
what's built into the JavaScript programming language provided by
browsers. But if the goal is to model human color perception, neither of
these color spaces is satisfactory, because they assume that all
full-intensity spectral colors are equally bright. But if you're like
most people, you see spectral yellow as much brighter than spectral blue
. There are better perceptual color spaces with names like L\*u\*v\* and
L\*a\*b\* that are based on research with human subjects to determine
true perceived brightness. Wikipedia explains all this and more at [HSL
and HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), where they
recommend ditching both of these simplistic color spaces.
