"Object-Oriented Programming with Sprites," you'll see a more flexible
way to send a message to a specific sprite using the tell and ask
blocks.

Notice, by the way, that the say block's first input slot is rectangular
rather than oval. This means the input can be any text string, not only
a number. In text input slots, a space character is shown as a brown
dot, so that you can count the number of spaces between words, and in
particular you can tell the difference between an empty slot and one
containing spaces. The brown dots are *not* shown on the stage if the
text is displayed.

The stage has its own scripting area. It can be selected by clicking on
the Stage icon at the left of the sprite corral. Unlike a sprite,
though, the stage can't move. Instead of costumes, it has *backgrounds:*
pictures that fill the entire stage area. The sprites appear in front of
the current background. In a complicated project, it's often convenient
to use a script in the stage's scripting area as the overall director of
the action.
