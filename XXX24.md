types: Text-or-number type and Number type. The former is indicated by a
rectangular box, the latter by a rounded box: . A third Scratch type,
Boolean (true/false), can be used in certain Control blocks with
hexagonal slots.

The Snap*!* types are an expanded collection including Procedure, List,
and Object types. Note that, with the exception of Procedure types, all
of the input type shapes are just reminders to the user of what the
block expects; they are not enforced by the language.
