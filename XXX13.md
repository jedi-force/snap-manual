By default, a project you save in the cloud is private; only you can see
it. There are two ways to make a project available to others. If you
share a project, you can give your friends a project URL (in your
browser's URL bar after you open the project) they can use to read it.
If you publish a project, it will appear on the Snap*!* web site, and
the whole world can see it. In any case, nobody other than you can ever
overwrite your project; if others ask to save it, they get their own
copy in their own account.

 Building a Block
================

The first version of Snap*!* was called BYOB, for "Build Your Own
Blocks." This was the first and is still the most important capability
we added to Scratch. (The name was changed because a few teachers have
no sense of humor. â˜¹ You pick your battles.) Scratch 2.0 and later also
has a partial custom block capability.
