Once you've created your account, you can log into it using the
"Login..." option from the Cloud menu:

![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image490.png){width="1.6875in"
height="2.0277777777777777in"}Use the user name and password that you
set up earlier. If you check the "Stay signed in" box, then you will be
logged in automatically the next time you run Snap*!* from the same
browser on the same computer. Check the box if you're using your own
computer and you don't share it with siblings. *Don't* check the box if
you're using a public computer at the library, at school, etc.

Once logged in, you can choose the "Cloud" option in the "Save Project"
dialog shown on page 37. You enter a project name, and optionally
project notes; your project will be saved online and can be loaded from
anywhere with net access. The project notes will be visible to other
users if you publish your project.
