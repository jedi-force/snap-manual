Visible stepping normally treats a call to a custom block as a single
step. If you want to see stepping inside a custom block you must take
these steps *in order:*

1.  ![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image123.png){width="0.2916666666666667in"
    height="0.16666666666666666in"}Turn on Visible Stepping.

2.  Select "Edit" in the context menu(s) of the block(s) you want to
    examine.

3.  Then start the program.

The Block Editor windows you open in step 2 do not have full editing
capability. You can tell because there is only one "OK" button at the
bottom, not the usual three buttons. Use the button to close these
windows when done stepping.
