At the heart of providing first class lists is the ability to make an
"anonymous" list---to make a list without simultaneously giving it a
name. The list reporter block does that.

![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image524.png){width="4.2in"
height="1.5694444444444444in"}At the right end of the block are two
left-and-right arrowheads. Clicking on these changes the number of
inputs to list, i.e., the number of elements in the list you are
building. Shift-clicking changes by three at a time.

![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image534.png){width="1.5034722222222223in"
height="1.8125in"}![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image535.png){width="2.24375in"
height="0.3215277777777778in"}You can use this block as input to many
other blocks:

![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image536.png){width="3.09375in"
height="0.7708333333333334in"}![](/snap-manual/assets/images/image537.png){width="1.8229166666666667in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"}Snap*!* does not have a "Make a list"
button like the one in Scratch. If you want a global "named list," make
a global variable and use the set block to put a list into the variable.
