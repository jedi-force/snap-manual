The Scripting Area
------------------

The scripting area is the middle vertical region of the Snap*!* window,
containing scripts and also some controls for the appearance and
behavior of a sprite. There is always a *current sprite,* whose scripts
are shown in the scripting area. A dark grey rounded rectangle in the
sprite corral shows which sprite (or the stage) is current. Note that
it's only the visible *display* of the scripting area that is "current"
for a sprite; all scripts of all sprites may be running at the same
time. Clicking on a sprite thumbnail in the sprite corral makes it
current. The stage itself can be selected as current, in which case the
appearance is different, with some primitives not shown.
